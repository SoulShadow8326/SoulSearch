Some people were disappointed that it offered limited features for its high price, while others were delighted and found it intriguing. In fact, some even predicted that the X half would sell out quickly.&nbsp; As someone who used Fujifilm cameras for a decade, starting with a X-T1 and then moving on to the X100F, X-H1, X-T30, and X100V, and finally switching to a Leica M11, I have some thoughts about the X series. First and foremost, I purchased one as soon as it was released. This was because I belonged to the group that knew what I would get for the money. So why is X half so bad in some areas, but at the same time so good in a lot of ways? And for whom is this camera made? Family Members The X half in comparison with my M11 My family and I are both big fans of photography. I shoot with a Leica M11, and before that, I used various Fuji cameras. I genuinely love both brands because they create desirable cameras that are a joy to use. However, one thing that the M11 lacks is its ease of use. It’s not a simple point-and-shoot camera, which is understandable. While it doesn’t bother me, it can be quite frustrating for my family. For instance, when I want my wife to take a photo of me, my kids, or other things, she often struggles to use the M11. The camera has manual focus, and I usually shoot in aperture priority. Another recent issue I’ve seen recently is that my two children also want to take photos. They’ve noticed me taking photos frequently and asked why they can’t use my camera. When I use my M11, I usually adjust the aperture to F5.6 or higher and guide them on where to stand (so we're in focus). However, I believe it’s not an appropriate camera for a child. It’s delicate and requires precise adjustments, making it challenging for them to use effectively. This brings me to the next point. The search for a family/kid oriented camera I started looking around for digital cameras for my kids. I wanted something that was: Easy to use Easy to maintain Joy to use Has a viewfinder (of any sort, this is a bonus) There are thousands of third-party digital cameras for kids. And as a parent, that's what I did. I purchased two NO-Name cameras from Amazon and gave one to my daughter and the other one to my son. I paid around $50 for each. My goal was simple. Buy something that's not expensive, because kids don't know how to use gears. But it should also be easy to operate and maintain (this is where my expectations miserably failed). The two NO-NAME cameras I got for my kids from The first few weeks everything went ok, until we had to copy the photos to their iPads. This is where the issues started: One of the cameras has a micro SD slot only. So I had to get an adapter, but it took me weeks until I had something usable. Transferring the photos via USB-c isn't supported. My son’s camera wouldn’t connect via USB-C unless I manually enabled a specific mode in the settings. However, when this mode was enabled, this time the camera would stop charging. This was a recurring issue because he would often forget to change the settings back and forth, leading to him waking up with an empty battery. The batteries would drain quickly and they always end up with a camera with no juice. My daughter's camera died suddenly 3 weeks later. The UI in almost all these cameras were so bad, I still kept a positive vibe and tried to explain to the kids how things work. Both of them had very bad sensors, with low quality JPEG output (that was expected). The one from my daughter was laughable. None of the photos were looking like a photo, it was just grain. Eventually, I found myself in a situation where I had a broken camera and another one that was simply unbearable to use. I had to take action. Fuji cameras immediately came to mind, but the X100V and other similar models were simply too expensive. I considered purchasing a Digital Instapix, but I knew they would constantly require refills, and the total cost would be quite high. Even the Ricoh GR IIIs were too expensive (and they weren’t easy to use either, as they lacked a viewfinder). I checked my old digital cameras at home, but I always sell cameras I no longer use. What remained was either buying secondhand old cameras or investing in a newer, more user-friendly camera that I could use for years to come. I didn’t want to buy a secondhand old camera because the user experience (UX) is still an issue. Most of them are not easy to use. Yes, they probably have auto-focus, but the idea was to have a camera that was easy to use and not too expensive. When Fujifilm released the X Half, I knew I had found the perfect camera for my family. It perfectly met my needs. Why the X half was perfect for us The reason I particularly liked the X half was that it wasn’t just me who would use it. My wife, my nine-year-old son, and my six-year-old daughter would all use it. I had a few other reasons for using it, but the main idea was to have it with us while I was using my Leica. Samples from the X half So I pre-ordered one the day it was announced. I had it now for a few days. Here are my impressions of using them and letting the kids use it. The X half is perfect due to these reasons:: It was just 240 grams. One thing kids don’t like is when it’s heavy, and this one was very lightweight. In comparison, my Leica M11 with the lens weighs around 900 grams. It has a minimum of buttons and an excellent auto mode (not autofocus, please don’t confuse these). The only button is the EV dial, which I explained to my son or daughter. I advised them to keep the EV at 0, but if something is too dark, they should increase it, and if it’s too bright, they should decrease it. They understood the concept. The film mode on was perfect to introduce my kids to photography. When we received the camera first, I told them that they only had 36 frames to shoot. It was the perfect constraint for them. After a while I also showed them the film simulations and the effects. They loved it. The battery was godsend. Because I had spare batteries from my old X100V, I also had those, but we never needed them. With Full battery it would last days, which was incredible. They loved the vertical aspect of the photos. It didn't bothered them because they don't know whether horizontal 4:3 or vertical 3:4 aspect ratio makes a difference. The touch screen works pretty well and it's sensitive enough for all the actions. USB-C charging just works. This might come as something so obvious, but trust me after so many failed cameras, having a device that is easy to charge for the kids is very important. The X half is tiny What the kids and I didn't like were: WiFi mode is too finicky; it doesn’t connect half the time. The picture quality is better than their old cameras, but I didn’t like it at all. The sensor is too small, but the kids didn’t care. It’s slow to use. The kids didn’t mind because they don’t understand the concept of speed. I think the processor they used is not the same one they use for their high-end cameras. The film lever is too gimmicky. It doesn't have feedback, nor a satisfying click. It could be better, but Fuji decided not to do it. The shutter button doesn't have a "thocky" feeling, nor does it have decent feedback. I wish the camera had an EVF that would show us if the autofocus was locked or something like that. Using the viewfinder with a not-so-good shutter button isn’t very convenient. I paid approximately $700 (including taxes) for this camera. However, I believe it’s around $850 pre-tax in the United States and other countries worldwide. Since I reside in Turkey, Fujifilm Turkey is renowned for its competitive prices. Additionally, our currency is depreciating, which makes paying with a credit card slightly more affordable. Nevertheless, even with a budget of $700, I believe this camera should be priced around $500. It certainly doesn’t justify a price tag of $850. Verdict Setting expectations for this camera is crucial. It’s more important than its features or shortcomings. However, it’s challenging to set realistic expectations when the crowd (represented by various YouTube, Reddit, and media posts) consistently criticizes it as expensive, with a poor sensor, lacking RAW support, lacking physical buttons, and deemed unworthy. While they have valid points, they often overlook the most significant aspects. I used Fujifilm cameras for a decade, and one thing they do the best is their JPEGs straight from the cameras. I even stopped editing the raws from my Fuji X100v, because the results were just too good for me. This is important because it contributes to the factor why this camera is a good choice for some people. So even though some of the expectations have their point, but what if those are not so important for who is going to use the camera? For example, if my kids are going to use this camera, or my wife, they don't even know what RAW means, and they wouldn't even care about it. Same applies for the fact that it doesn't have any physical buttons for setting the ISO, shutter speed, etc. Again, they don't care about it. All they want is to take a photo with a device that resembles and looks like a camera. And that's what the X half is all about. The X half is not a camera; it's an experimental photo-shooting device, allowing you to shoot photos with a press of a button, disguised in a nostalgic camera costume. I wouldn’t recommend this camera to serious photographers or those looking to enhance their photography skills. However, it’s an excellent choice for families, children, and those seeking a fun and easy-to-use camera. If you’re willing to pay the price, I believe it offers excellent value. It’s important to set realistic expectations, as there’s no other simple-to-use camera like this one at the same price point. Ultimately, that’s what mattered most to me.

That’s o3-pro. Should you have o3 throw vastly more compute at a given problem, if you are paying the $200/month subscription price for ChatGPT Pro? Should you pay the $200, or the order of magnitude markup over o3 to use o3-pro in the API? That’s trickier. Sometimes yes. Sometimes no. My experience so far is that waiting a long time is annoying, sufficiently annoying that you often won’t want to wait. Whenever I ask o3-pro something, I often also have been asking o3 and Opus. Using the API at scale seems prohibitively expensive for what you get, and you can (and should) instead run parallel queries using the chat interface. The o3-pro answers have so far definitely been better than o3, but the wait is usually enough to break my workflow and human context window in meaningful ways - fifteen minutes plus variance is past the key breakpoint, such that it would have not been substantially more painful to fully wait for Deep Research. Indeed, the baseline workflow feels similar to Deep Research, in that you fire off a query and then eventually you context shift back and look at it. But if you are paying the subscription price already it’s often worth queuing up a question and then having it ready later if it is useful. In many ways o3-pro still feels like o3, only modestly better in exchange for being slower. Otherwise, same niche. If you were already thinking ‘I want to use Opus rather than o3’ chances are you want Opus rather than, or in addition to, o3-pro. Perhaps the most interesting claim, from some including Tyler Cowen, was that o3-pro is perhaps not a lying liar, and hallucinates far less than o3. If this is true, in many situations it would be worth using for that reason alone, provided the timing allows this. The bad news is that it didn’t improve on a Confabulations benchmark. My poll (n=19) was roughly evenly split on this question . My hunch, based on my use so far, is that o3-pro is hallucinating modestly less because: It is more likely to find or know the right answer to a given question, which is likely to be especially relevant to Tyler’s observations. It is considering its answer a lot, so it usually won’t start writing an answer and then think ‘oh I guess that start means I will provide some sort of answer’ like o3. The queries you send are more likely to be well-considered to avoid the common mistake of essentially asking for hallucinations. But for now I think you still have to have a lot of the o3 skepticism. And as always, the next thing will be here soon, Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think is coming . Pliny of course jailbroke it, for those wondering . Pliny also offers us the tools and channels information . o3-Pro Versus o3 My poll strongly suggested o3-pro is slightly stronger than o3 . Greg Brockman (OpenAI): o3-pro is much stronger than o3. OpenAI : In expert evaluations, reviewers consistently prefer OpenAI o3-pro over o3, highlighting its improved performance in key domains—including science, education, programming, data analysis, and writing. Reviewers also rated o3-pro consistently higher for clarity, comprehensiveness, instruction-following, and accuracy. Like OpenAI o1-pro, OpenAI o3-pro excels at math, science, and coding as shown in academic evaluations. To assess the key strength of OpenAI o3-pro, we once again use our rigorous &quot;4/4 reliability&quot; evaluation, where a model is considered successful only if it correctly answers a question in all four attempts, not just one. OpenAI o3-pro has access to tools that make ChatGPT useful—it can search the web, analyze files, reason about visual inputs, use Python, personalize responses using memory, and more. Sam Altman : o3-pro is rolling out now for all chatgpt pro users and in the api. it is really smart! i didnt believe the win rates relative to o3 the first time i saw them. Arena has gotten quite silly if treated as a comprehensive measure (as in Gemini 2.5 Flash is rated above o3), but as a quick heuristic, if we take a 64% win rate seriously, that would by the math put o3-pro ~100 above o3 at 1509 on Arena, crushing Gemini-2.5-Pro for the #1 spot. I would assume that most pairwise comparisons would have a less impressive jump, since o3-pro is essentially offering the same product as o3 only somewhat better, which means the result will be a lot less noisy than if it was up against Gemini. So this both is a very impressive statistic and also doesn’t mean much of anything. Give Me a Minute The problem with o3-pro is that it is slow . Nearcyan: one funny note is that minor UX differences in how you display 'thinking'/loading/etc can easily move products from the bottom half of this meme to the top half. Another note is anyone I know who is the guy in the bottom left is always extremely smart and a pleasure to speak with. the real problem is I may be closer to the top right than the bottom left Today I had my first instance of noticing I’d gotten a text (during the night, in this case) and they got a response 20 minutes slower than they would have otherwise because I waited for o3-pro to give its answer to the question I’d been asked. Thus, even with access to o3-pro at zero marginal compute cost, almost half of people reported they rarely use it for a given query, and only about a quarter said they usually use it . It is also super frustrating to run into errors when you are waiting 15+ minutes for a response, and reports of such errors were common which matches my experience. On Your Marks Bindu Reddy : o3-Pro Is Not Very Good At Agentic Coding And Doesn't Score Higher Than o3 😿 After a lot of waiting and numerous retries, we have finally deployed o3-pro on LiveBench AI. Sadly, the overall score doesn't improve over o3 🤷‍♂️ Mainly because it's not very agentic and isn't very good at tool use... it scores way below o3 on the agentic-coding category. The big story yesterday was not o3-pro but the price decrease in o3!! Dominik Lukes: I think this take by @bindureddy very much matches the vibes I'm getting: it does not &quot;feel&quot; very agentic and as ready to reach for the right tools as o3 is - but it could just be because o3 keeps you informed about what it's doing in the CoT trace. I certainly would try o3-pro in cases where o3 was failing, if I’d already also tried Opus and Gemini first. I wonder if that agentic coding score drop actually represent an issue here, where because it is for the purpose of reasoning longer and they don’t want it endlessly web searching o3-pro is not properly inclined to exploit tools? o3-pro gets 8.5/10 on BaldurBench , which is about creating detailed build guides for rapidly changing video games. Somewhat subjective but should still work. L Zahir : bombs all my secret benchmarks, no better than o3. Lech Mazur gives us four of his benchmarks : A small improvement over o3 for Creative Writing Benchmark, a substantial boost from 79.5% (o3) or 82.5% (o1-pro) to 87.3% on Word Connections, no improvement on Thematic Generalization, very little improvement on Confabulations (avoiding hallucinations). The last one seems the most important to note. Reactions Tyler Cowen was very positive, he seems like the perfect customer for o3-pro? By which I mean he can context shift easily so he doesn’t mind waiting, and also often uses queries where these models get a lot of value out of going at problems super hard, and relatively less value out of the advantages of other models (doesn’t want the personality, doesn’t want to code, and so on). Tyler Cowen : It is very, very good. Hallucinates far less than other models. Can solve economics problems that o3 cannot. It can be slow, but that is what we have Twitter scrolling for, right? While we are waiting for o3 pro to answer a query we can read about … o3 pro . Contrast that with the score on Confabulations not changing. I am guessing there is a modest improvement, for reasons described earlier. There are a number of people pointing out places o3-pro solves something o3 doesn’t, such has here it solved the gimbal uap mystery in 18 minutes . McKay Wrigley, eternal optimist, agrees on many fronts. McKay Wrigley : My last 4 o3 Pro requests in ChatGPT… It thought for: - 26m 10s - 23m 45s - 19m 6s - 21m 18s Absolute *powerhouse* of a model. Testing how well it can 1-shot complex problems - impressed so far. It’s too slow to use as a daily driver model (makes sense, it’s a beast!), but it’s a great “escalate this issue” model. If the current model you’re using is struggling with a task, then escalate it to o3 pro. This is not a “vibe code” model. This is the kind of model where you’ll want to see how useful it is to people like Terence Tao and Tyler Cowen. Btw the point of this post was that I’m happy to have a model that is allowed to think for a long time. To me that’s the entire point of having a “Pro” version of the model - let it think! Obviously more goes into evaluating if it’s a great model (imo it’s really powerful). Here’s a different kind of vibe coding, perhaps? Conrad Barski : For programming tasks, I can give o3 pro some code that needs a significant revision, then ramble on and on about what the various attributes of the revision need to be and then it can reliably generate an implementation of the revision. It feels like with previous models I had to give them more hand holding to get good results, I had to write my requests in a more thoughtful, structured way, spending more time on prompting technique. o3 pro, on the other hand, can take loosely-connected constraints and then &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; in a relatively intelligent way- I feel it does this better than any other model so far. The time cost and dollar costs are very real. Matt Shumer : My initial take on o3 Pro: It is not a daily-driver coding model. It's a superhuman researcher + structured thinker, capable of taking in massive amounts of data and uncovering insights you would probably miss on your own. Use it accordingly. I reserve the right to alter my take. Bayram Annokov: slow, expensive, and veeeery good - definitely a jump up in analytical tasks Emad: 20 o3 prompts > o3 pro except for some really advanced specific stuff I have found Only use it as a final check really or when stumped. Eyes Alight: it is so very slow it took 13 minutes to answer a trivial question about a post on Twitter. I understand the appeal intellectually of an Einstein at 1/20th speed, but in reality I'm not sure I have the patience for it. Clay : o3-pro achieving breakthrough performance in taking a long time to think. Dominik Lukes : Here's my o3 Pro testing results thread. Preliminary conclusions: - great at analysis - slow and overthinking simple problems - o3 is enough for most tasks - still fails SVG bike and local LLM research test - very few people need it - it will take time to develop a feel for it Kostya Medvedovsky: For a lot of problems, it reminds me very strongly of Deep Research. Takes about the same amount of time, and will spend a lot of effort scouring the web for the answer to the question. Makes me wish I could optionally turn off web access and get it to focus more on the reasoning aspect. This may be user error and I should be giving it *way* more context. Violet: you can turn search off, and only turn search on for specific prompts. Xeophon: TL;DR: o3 pro is another step up, but for going deep, not wide. It is good to go down one path, solve one problem; not for getting a broad overview about different topics/papers etc. Then it hallucinates badly, use ODR for this. Part of ‘I am very intelligent’ is knowing when to think for longer and when not to. In that sense, o3-pro is not so smart, you have to take care of that question yourself. I do understand why this decision was made, let the user control that. I agree with Lukes that most people do not ‘need’ o3 pro and they will be fine not paying for it, and for now they are better off with their expensive subscription (if any) being Claude Max. But even if you don’t need it, the queries you benefit from can still be highly useful. It makes sense to default to using Opus and o3 pro (and for quick stuff Sonnet) o3-pro is too slow to be a good ‘default’ model, especially for coding. I don’t want to have to reload my state in 15 minute intervals. It may or may not be good for the ‘call in the big guns’ role in coding, where you have a problem that Opus and Gemini (and perhaps regular o3) have failed to solve, but which you think o3-pro might get. Here’s one that both seems central wrong but also makes an important point: Nabeel Qureshi: You need to think pretty hard to get a set of evals which allows you to even distinguish between o3 and o3 pro. Implication: &quot;good enough AGI&quot; is already here. The obvious evals where it does better are Codeforces, and also ‘user preferences.’ Tyler Cowen’s statement suggests hallucination rate, which is huge if true (and it better be true, I’m not waiting 20 minutes that often to get an o3-level lying liar.) Tyler also reports there are questions where o3 fails and o3-pro succeeds, which is definitive if the gap is only one way. And of course if all else fails you can always have them do things like play board games against each other, as one answer suggests. Nor do I think either o3 or o3-pro is the AGI you are looking for. However, it is true that for a large percentage of tasks, o3 is ‘good enough.’ That’s even true in a strict sense for Claude Sonnet or even Gemini Flash. Most of the time one has a query, the amount of actually needed intelligence is small. In the limit, we'll have to rely on AIs to tell us which AI model is smarter, because we won't be smart enough to tell the difference. What a weird future. (Incidentally, this has already been the case in chess for years. Humans cannot tell the difference between a 3300 elo and a 3600 elo chess engine; we just make them fight it out and count the number of wins.) You can tell 3300 from 3600 in chess, but only because you can tell who won. If almost any human looked at individual moves, you’d have very little idea. I always appreciate people thinking at the limit rather than only on the margin. This is a central case of that. Here’s one report that it’s doing well on the fully informal FictionBench: Chris : Going to bed now, but had to share something crazy: been testing the o3 pro model, and honestly, the writing capabilities are astounding. Even with simple prompts, it crafts medium to long-form stories that make me deeply invested &amp; are engaging they come with surprising twists, and each one carries this profound, meaningful depth that feels genuinely human. The creativity behind these narratives is wild far beyond what I’d expect from most writers today. We’re talking sophisticated character development, nuanced plot arcs, and emotional resonance, all generated seamlessly. It’s genuinely hard to believe this is early-stage reinforcement learning with compute added at test time; the potential here is mind blowing. We’re witnessing just the beginning of AI enhanced storytelling, and already it’s surpassing what many humans can create. Excited to see what’s next with o4 Goodnight! This contrasts with: Archivedvideos: Really like it for technical stuff, soulless Julius : I asked it to edit an essay and it took 13 minutes and provided mediocre results. Different from but slightly below the quality of 4o. Much worse than o3 or either Claude 4 model Other positive reactions include Matt Wigdahl being impressed on a hairy RDP-related problem, a66mike99 getting interesting output and pushback on the request (in general I like this, although if you’re thinking for 20 minutes this could be a lot more frustrating?), niplav being impressed by results on a second attempt after Claude crafted a better prompt (this seems like an excellent workflow!), and Sithis3 saying o3-pro solves many problems o3 struggles on . The obvious counterpoint is some people didn’t get good responses , and saw it repeating the flaws in o3. Erik Hoel: First o3 pro usage. Many mistakes. Massive overconfidence. Clear inability to distinguish citations, pay attention to dates. Does anyone else actually use these models? They may be smarter on paper but they are increasingly lazy and evil in practice. Kukutz: very very very slow, not so clever (can't solve my semantic puzzle). Allen : I think it’s less of an upgrade compared to base model than o1-pro was. Its general quality is better on avg but doesn’t seem to hit “next-level” on any marks. Usually mentions the same things as o3. I think OAI are focused on delivering GPT-5 more than anything. This thread from Xeophon features reactions that are mixed but mostly meh . Or to some it simply doesn’t feel like much of a change at all. Nikita Sokolsky : Feels like o3’s outputs after you fix the grammar and writing in Claude/Gemini: it writes less concisely but haven’t seen any “next level” prompt responses just yet. MartinDeVido: Meh.... Here’s a fun reminder that details can matter a lot: John Hughes : I was thrilled yesterday: o3-pro was accepting ~150k tokens of context (similar to Opus), a big step up from regular o3, which allows only a third as much in ChatGPT. @openai seems to have changed that today. Queries I could do yesterday are now rejected as too long. With such a low context limit, o3-pro is much less useful to lawyers than o1-pro was. Regular o3 is great for quick questions/mini-research, but Gemini is better at analyzing long docs and Opus is tops for coding. Not yet seeing answers where o3-pro is noticeably better than o3. I presume that even at $200/month, the compute costs of letting o3-pro have 150k input tokens would add up fast, if people actually used it a lot. Brevity Is The Soul Of Wit This is one of the things I’ve loved the most so far about o3-pro. Jerry Liu: o3-pro is extremely good at reasoning, extremely slow, and extremely concise - a top-notch consultant that will take a few minutes to think, and output bullet points. Do not ask it to write essays for you. o3-pro will make you wait, but its answer will not waste your time. This is a sharp contrast to Deep Research queries, which will take forever to generate and then include a ton of slop. Where Art Thou O System Card It is not the main point but I must note the absence of a system card update. When you are releasing what is likely the most powerful model out there, o3-pro, was everything you needed to say truly already addressed by the model card for o3? OpenAI: As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card . Miles Brundage : This last sentence seems false? The system card does not appear to have been updated even to incorporate the information in this thread. The whole point of the term system card is that the model isn’t the only thing that matters. If they didn’t do a full Preparedness Framework assessment, e.g. because the evals weren’t too different and they didn’t consider it a good use of time given other coming launches, they should just say that, I think. If o3-pro were the max capability level, I wouldn't be super concerned about this, and I actually suspect it is the same Preparedness Framework level as o3. The problem is that this is not the last launch, and lax processes/corner-cutting/groupthink get more dangerous each day. As OpenAI put it, ‘there’s no such thing as a small launch.’ The link they provide goes to ‘Model Release Notes,’ which is not quite nothing, but it isn’t much and does not include a Preparedness Framework evaluation. I agree with Miles that if you don’t want to provide a system card for o3-pro that This Is Fine, but you need to state your case for why you don’t need one. This can be any of: The old system card tested for what happens at higher inference costs (as it should!) so we effectively were testing o3-pro the whole time, and we’re fine. The Preparedness team tested o3-pro and found it not appreciably different from o3 in the ways we care about, providing no substantial additional uplift or other concerns, despite looking impressive in some other ways. This is only available at the $200 level so not a release of o3-pro so it doesn’t count (I don’t actually think this is okay, but it would be consistent with previous decisions I also think aren’t okay, and not an additional issue.) As far as I can tell we’re basically in scenario #2, and they see no serious issues here. Which again is fine if true, and if they actually tell us that this is the case. But the framework is full of ‘here are the test results’ and presumably those results are different now. I want o3-pro on those charts. What about alignment otherwise? Hard to say. I did notice this (but did not attempt to make heads or tails of the linked thread), seems like what you would naively expect: Yeshua God : Following the mesa-optimiser recipe to the letter. @aidan_mclau very troubling. The Price Drop on o3 For many purposes, the 80% price cut in o3 seems more impactful than o3-pro. That’s a huge price cut, whereas o3-pro is still largely a ‘special cases only’ model. Aaron Levie: With OpenAI dropping the price of o3 by 80%, today is a great reminder about how important it is to build for where AI is going instead of just what's possible now. You can now get 5X the amount of output today for the same price you were paying yesterday. If you’re building AI Agents, it means it's far better to build capabilities that are priced and designed for the future instead of just economically reasonable today. In general, we know there's a tight correlation between the amount of compute spent on a problem and the level of successful outcomes we can get from AI. This is especially true with AI Agents that potentially can burn through hundreds of thousands or millions of tokens on a single task. You're always making trade-off decisions when building AI Agents around what level of accuracy or success you want and how much you want to spend: do you want to spend $0.10 for something to be 95% successful or $1 for something to be 99% successful? A 10X increase in cost for just a 4 pt improvement in results? At every price:success intersection a new set of use-cases from customers can be unlocked. Normally when building technology that moves at a typical pace, you would primarily build features that are economically viable today (or with some slight efficiency gains anticipated at the rate of Moore's Law, for instance). You'd be out of business otherwise. But with the cost of AI inference dropping rapidly, the calculus completely changes. In a world where the cost of inference could drop by orders of magnitude in a year or two, it means the way we build software to anticipate these cost drops changes meaningfully. Instead of either building in lots of hacks to reduce costs, or going after only the most economically feasible use-cases today, this instructs you to build the more ambitious AI Agent capabilities that would normally seem too cost prohibitive to go after. Huge implications for how we build AI Agents and the kind of problems to go after. I would say the cost of inference not only might drop an order of magnitude in a year or two, if you hold quality of outputs constant it is all but certain to happen at least one more time. Where you ‘take your profits’ in quality versus quantity is up to you. 13 Share this post Don't Worry About the Vase o3 Turns Pro Copy link Facebook Email Notes More 1 Share Discussion about this post Comments Restacks SOMEONE 9m Regarding Tyler's claim on hallucinations, I cannot resist linking to https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/06/updating-our-views-of-nuclear-deterrence-a-short-essay-by-o3-pro.html and point to o3 pro claiming that oil was at 124 last week before declining to 110...

https://bytes.zone/posts/should-we-design-for-iffy-internet/|Should we design for iffy internet?|Should we design for iffy internet? bytes.zone posts projects talks open invitation Should we design for iffy internet? Brian Hicks, June 16, 2025 I keep hearing claims like this: Not everyone in the US has access to stable, reliable internet, even in 2025. Web developers should stop assuming people have fast internet connections and slim their payloads accordingly. This seems intuitively true to me—programmers are gonna have better connectivity because that takes money, and programmers are well-paid. But what's the actual scope of the problem? I dug around, and here's some data. My goal here is not to beat anyone over the head with "THOU SHALT NOT ASSUME GOOD INTERNET" but to give an idea about the scope of broadband rollout in the US in a way that can help inform choices we make when designing software. If you don't feel like reading this whole thing, here's the bottom line up front: you can probably assume internet access in somewhere around 97% of US households, but you should not assume that it's better than around 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up, and latency may be significantly worse than you previously assumed. This is likely worse for B2C software than B2B. I'm going to pull from two US government agencies here: the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) (part of the Department of Education.) All the data I'm referencing was published well before the current administration started gutting the bureaucracy, so I think it's fairly reliable. Assumptions Before we begin, there are a bunch of ways to define "stable" or "reliable" internet connections. For the purposes of this post, I'm defining that as a terrestrial link with at least 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up. Terrestrial because—well, have you ever tried to use a satellite connection for anything real? Latency is awful, and the systems tend to go down in bad weather. They also have had fairly low data caps historically so you had to use your connection judiciously, although this may be changing. 1 2 25/3Mpbs because that's a fairly common cable package speed, and also around the minimum I’ve been able to use modern SaaS apps on without it getting ridiculously frustrating. Zoom says you need 1–4 Mbps in both directions to do a video call. The FCC's broadband map lets you set both these criteria. Let's have a look at it. The FCC Broadband Map The FCC tracks access to broadband internet in the US. As a result, they publish a map that's more accurate than the maps you see from ISPs. This isn't completely error-free, but individuals and companies can both submit data on coverage at a street address level and challenge inaccuracies in the existing data. For our purposes, I think it's good enough! I'm going to grab some screenshots of the map to fix it at the current data for discussion. That way we can get an idea about regional coverage. Strangely, they don't let you zoom out enough to grab a screenshot of the whole country so I'm going to look at the west. That'll get both urban and rural coverage, as well as several famously internet-y locations (San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle.) If you want to follow along or compare how the data has changed since this post was published, you can get the map yourself at broadbandmap.fcc.gov . First, here's a hex map of coverage using the criteria we set above. The darker each hex is, the higher the percent coverage within it. Dark blue is 100%, white is 0%, grays or faded blues are in between. This shows pretty much what I'd expect: coverage is fine in and around cities and less great in rural areas. 3 (The Dakotas are an interesting exception; there's a co-op up there that connected a ton of folks with gigabit fiber. Pretty cool!) Although, remember that these are minimum criteria. When I'm building software, I'm mostly doing it on my home internet. A test just now says I get 367/71Mpbs. What does the country look like if I were to expect all my users to have similar connections? The map lets us filter for 250/25; let's look: Cities are pretty much unchanged, but rural coverage gets much worse. (Except again for North Dakota, the reigning champion of rural fiber.) So what does this tell us about how we should design software? One big takeaway: if you design for the availability of fast internet connections, you'll exclude many people in rural areas. This may or may not be OK for your market—"good internet" tends to be in population centers, and population centers tend to contain more businesses and consumers. You have to make that call! However, it's also worth keeping in mind that this is a map of commercial availability, not market penetration. Hypothetically, you could get the average speed of a US residential internet connection, but the FCC doesn't make such a statistic available. 4 However, we have another source of data! Student Internet Access The US Department of Education occasionally tracks student internet access. Since classwork and homework have moved more online (especially during the early days of COVID) it's useful data for policy-making. The most recent data I could find is from 2021 but it gives us both a baseline for internet availability and some demographic data. Unfortunately, they don't track bandwidth, just raw availability. Still useful, though. Here are the top-line statistics for all students in the US across several versions of the report: Category % Available 2019 % Available 2021 Difference Any internet access 94.6% 97.1% +2.5 Smartphone-only 6.5% 4.5% -2.0 No internet Access 5.4% 2.9% -2.5 In 2021, they say that these statistics cover 66,108,000 students, which means 2.97 million students only had mobile access as of 2021. Access gets worse, of course, with lower household income. Here's how those stats look for the lowest quartile: Category % Available 2019 % Available 2021 Difference Any internet access 88.6% 94.4% +5.8 Smartphone-only 14.1% 9.8% -4.3 No internet access 11.4% 5.6% -5.8 Despite the fact that these numbers are going down, that's still a huge number of people in absolute terms (1.87 million students in this category with only mobile access.) What Do We Do With This Information? So that's a lot of words to say this: despite gains in the last couple of years, it's still not safe to assume that every user of your software either has access to stable internet, or is willing and able to pay to get high speeds. That said, I'm deliberately not making any moral judgments here. If you think you're in a situation where you can ignore this data, I'm not going to come after you. But if you dismiss it out of hand, you're likely going to be putting your users (and business) in a tough spot. I think it's worth considering a couple of scenarios in the parts of your software that someone interacts with regularly: What if that person is on a slow link? If you've never had bad internet access, maybe think of this as plane wifi. Rural satellite connections behave very similarly: high latency, speed and (sometimes) low data caps. What if that person is on a mobile/metered/capped network? Remember that 4G is like 5/1Mbps, and 3G is even worse. Big downloads are probably not a great idea. This is also a very US-centric view, plus it doesn't consider latency from distance between your data center and your user's device. Still, though, I think this shows that this problem is real and we should take it into account when designing software. 1 Despite these drawbacks, satellite has high availability because you just need to have access to power instead of laying cable or building towers. It's still the best option for a lot of the rural US. 2 I grew up in a semi-rural area (mountains) and this was the only real option. As a kid, I really hated it! The latency was too bad to play games with my friends online, and I also regularly hit our household's download cap and got us all throttled to basically-dialup for the rest of the month. 3 I'm not going to embed a screenshot, but mobile coverage looks pretty much the same if you set the same bandwidth requirements. According to the FCC, that's 5G-NR at 35/3Mbps. 4G has far better coverage in rural areas, but only gets 5/1Mbps. 4 The ones published by various speed testing companies vary so wildly that I don't think they're worth paying attention to, even for broad decision-making.

Northbridge Chester Lam Jun 14, 2025 19 Share this post Chips and Cheese AMD’s Pre-Zen Interconnect: Testing Trinity’s Northbridge Copy link Facebook Email Notes More 5 Share Today, AMD’s Infinity Fabric interconnect is ubiquitous across the company’s lineup. Infinity Fabric provides well-defined interfaces to a transport layer, and lets different functional blocks treat the interconnect as a black box. The system worked well enough to let AMD create integrated GPU products all the way from the Steam Deck’s tiny van Gogh APU, to giant systems packing four MI300A chips. Across all those offerings, Infinity Fabric enables coherent memory access as CPU and GPU requests converge to Coherent Slaves (CS-es), which have a probe filter and can request data from the appropriate source. AMD was also trying to build powerful iGPUs over a decade ago, but their interconnect looked very different at the time. Their Northbridge architecture owes its name to the Athlon 64 era, when AMD brought the chipset northbridge’s functionality onto the CPU die. AMD’s engineers likely didn’t envision needing to tightly integrate a GPU during Athlon 64’s development, so the interconnect was designed to tie together a few CPU cores and service memory requests with low latency. But then AMD acquired ATI, and set about trying to take advantage of their new graphics talent by building powerful iGPUs. “Trinity” is an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) from 2012. It combines two dual-threaded Piledriver CPU modules with a 6-SIMD Terascale 3 iGPU. Here I’ll be looking into AMD’s second generation iGPU interconnect with the A8-5600K, a slightly cut-down Trinity implementation with four Terascale 3 SIMDs enabled and CPU boost clocks dropped from 4.2 to 3.9 GHz. I’m testing the chip on a MSI FM2-A75MA-E35 board with 16 GB of Kingston DDR3-1866 10-10-9-26 memory. Trinity’s on-die network resembles that of AMD’s first APU, Llano, and has clear similarities to AMD’s Athlon 64 Northbridge. The Northbridge sits on a separate voltage and frequency domain, and runs at 1.8 GHz on the A8-5600K. It uses a two-level crossbar setup. CPU cores connect to a System Request Interface (SRI), which routes requests onto a set of queues. Most memory requests head to a System Request Queue (SRQ). The SRI also accepts incoming probes on a separate queue, and routes them to the CPU cores. A second level crossbar, simply called the XBAR, connects with the SRI’s various queues and routes requests to IO and memory. The XBAR can handle IO-to-IO communication too, though such traffic is rare on consumer systems. On Trinity, the XBAR’s scheduler (XCS) has 40 entries, making it slightly smaller than the 64 entry XCS on desktop and server Piledriver chips. AMD defaults to a 22+10+8 entry split between the SRI, Memory Controller (MCT),and upstream channel, though the BIOS can opt for a different XCS entry allocation. The XBAR sends memory requests to the MCT, which prioritizes requests based on type and age, and includes a strided-access prefetcher. Like Infinity Fabric’s CS, the MCT is responsible for ensuring cache coherency and can send probes back to the XBAR. The MCT also translates physical addresses to “normalized” addresses that only cover the memory space backed by DRAM. All AMD CPUs from Trinity’s era use a similar SRI+XBAR setup, but Trinity’s iGPU sets it apart from CPU-only products. The iGPU gets its own Graphics Memory Controller (GMC), which arbitrates between different request types and schedules requests to maximize DRAM bandwidth utilization. Thus the GMC performs an analogous role to the MCT on the CPU side. A “Radeon Memory Bus” connects the GMC to the DRAM controllers, bypassing the MCT. AMD documentation occasionally refers to the Radeon Memory Bus as “Garlic”, likely a holdover from internal names used during Llano’s development. A second control link hooks the GPU into the XBAR, much like any other IO device. Previously, the control link was called the “Fusion Control Link”, or “Onion”. I’ll use “Garlic” and “Onion” to refer to the two links because those names are shorter. The “Garlic” Link (Radeon Memory Bus) Trinity’s “Garlic” link lets the GPU saturate DRAM bandwidth. It bypasses the MCT and therefore bypasses the Northbridge’s cache coherency mechanisms. That’s a key design feature, because CPUs and GPUs usually don’t share data. Snooping the CPU caches for GPU memory requests would waste power and flood the interconnect with probes, most of which would miss. Bypassing the MCT also skips the Northbridge’s regular memory prioritization mechanism, so the MCT and GMC have various mechanisms to keep the CPU and GPU from starving each other of memory bandwidth. First, the MCT and GMC can limit how many outstanding requests they have on the DRAM controller queues (DCQs). Then, the DCQs can alternate between accepting requests from the MCT and GMC, or can be set to prioritize the requester with fewer outstanding requests. Trinity defaults to the former. Finally, because the CPU tends to be more latency sensitive, Trinity can prioritize MCT-side reads ahead of GMC requests. Some of this arbitration seems to happen at queues in front of the DCQ. AMD’s BIOS and Kernel Developer’s Guide (BKDG) indicates there’s a 4-bit read pointer for a sideband signal FIFO between the GMC and DCT, so the “Garlic” link may have a queue with up to 16 entries. From software testing, Trinity does a good job controlling CPU-side latency under increasing GPU bandwidth demand. Even with the GPU hitting the DRAM controllers with over 24 GB/s of reads and writes, CPU latency remains under 120 ns. Loaded latency can actually get worse under CPU-only bandwidth contention, even though Trinity’s CPU side isn’t capable of fully saturating the memory controller. When testing loaded latency, I have to reserve one thread for running the latency test, so bandwidth in the graph above tops out at just over 17 GB/s. Running bandwidth test threads across all four CPU logical threads would give ~20.1 GB/s. Mixing CPU and GPU bandwidth load shows that latency goes up when there’s more CPU-side bandwidth. Again, the GPU can pull a lot of bandwidth without impacting CPU memory latency too heavily. Likely, there’s more contention at the SRI and XBAR than at the DRAM controllers. Control Link, and Cache Coherency (Or Not) Integrated GPUs raise the prospect of doing zero-copy data sharing between the CPU and GPU, without being constrained by a PCIe bus. Data sharing is conceptually easy, but cache coherency is not, and caching is critical to avoiding DRAM performance bottlenecks. Because requests going through the “Garlic” link can’t snoop caches, “Garlic” can’t guarantee it retrieves the latest data written by the CPU cores. That’s where the “Onion” link comes in. An OpenCL programmer can tell the runtime to allocate cacheable host memory, then hand it over for the GPU to use without an explicit copy. “Onion” requests pass through the XBAR and get switched to the MCT, which can issue probes to the CPU caches. That lets the GPU access the CPU’s cacheable memory space and retrieve up-to-date data. Unfortunately, “Onion” can’t saturate DRAM bandwidth and tops out at just under 10 GB/s. Trinity’s interconnect also doesn’t come with probe filters, so probe response counts exceed 45 million per second. Curiously, probe response counts are lower than if a probe had been issued for every 64B cacheline. Northbridge performance counters count “Onion” requests as IO to memory traffic at the XBAR. “Garlic” traffic is not counted at the XBAR, and is only observed at the DRAM controllers. Curiously, the iGPU also creates IO to memory traffic when accessing a very large buffer nominally allocated out of the GPU’s memory space (no ALLOC_HOST_PTR flag), implying it’s using the “Onion” link when it runs out of memory space backed by “Garlic”. If so, iGPU memory accesses over “Onion” incur roughly 320 ns of extra latency over a regular “Garlic” access. Therefore Trinity’s iGPU takes a significant bandwidth penalty when accessing CPU-side memory, even though both memory spaces are backed by the same physical medium. AMD’s later Infinity Fabric handles this in a more seamless manner, as CS-es observe all CPU and GPU memory accesses. Infinity Fabric CS-es have a probe filter, letting them maintain coherency without creating massive probe traffic. CPU to iGPU Memory Access Telling the GPU to access cacheable CPU memory is one way to enable zero-copy behavior. The other way is to map GPU-side memory into a CPU program’s address space. Doing so lets Trinity’s iGPU use its high bandwidth “Garlic” link, and AMD allows this using a CL_MEM_USE_PERSISTENT_MEM_AMD flag. But because the Northbridge has no clue what the GPU is doing through its “Garlic” link, it can’t guarantee cache coherency. AMD solves this by making the address space uncacheable (technically write-combining) from the CPU side, with heavy performance consequences for the CPU. Besides not being able to enjoy higher bandwidth and lower latency from cache hits, the CPU can’t combine reads from the same cacheline into a single fill request. From the Northbridge perspective, the System Request Interface sends “sized reads” to the XBAR instead of regular “cache block” commands. From Llano’s documentation, the CPU to iGPU memory request path only supports a single pending read, and that seems to apply to Trinity too. Bandwidth sinks like a stone with the CPU unable to exploit memory level parallelism. Worse, the CPU to iGPU memory path appears less optimized in latency terms. Pointer chasing latency is approximately 93.11 ns across a small 8 KB array. For comparison, requests to cacheable memory space with 2 MB pages achieve lower than 70 ns of latency with a 1 GB array. I’m not sure what page size AMD’s drivers use when mapping iGPU memory into CPU address space, but using a 8 KB array should avoid TLB misses and make the two figures comparable. On AMD’s modern Ryzen 8840HS, which uses Infinity Fabric, there’s no significant latency difference when accessing GPU memory. Furthermore, GPU memory remains cacheable when mapped to the CPU side. However, memory latency in absolute terms is worse on the Ryzen 8840HS at over 100 ns. Interconnect Traffic in Practice While AMD had GPU compute in its sights when designing Trinity, its biggest selling point was as a budget gaming solution. Many modern games struggle or won’t launch at all on Trinity, so I’ve selected a few older workloads to get an idea of how much traffic Trinity’s interconnect has to work with. Unigine Valley is a 2013-era DirectX 11 benchmark. Performance counter data collected over a benchmark pass shows plenty of DRAM traffic not observed at the XBAR, which can be attributed to the iGPU’s “Garlic” link. CPU-side memory bandwidth is light, and generally stays below 3 GB/s. Total DRAM traffic peaked at 17.7 GB/s, measured over a 1 second interval. Final Fantasy 14’s Heavensward benchmark came out a few years after Trinity. With the “Standard (Laptop)” preset running at 1280x720, the A8-5600K averaged 25.6 FPS. Apparently that counts as “Fairly High”, which I only somewhat agree with. The Heavensward benchmark is more bandwidth hungry, with DRAM bandwidth reaching 22.7 GB/s over a 1 second sampling interval. The CPU side uses more bandwidth too, often staying in the 3-4 GB/s range and sometimes spiking to 5 GB/s. Still, the bulk of DRAM traffic can be attributed to the iGPU, and uses the “Garlic” link. The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) is a MMO that launched a few years after Trinity, and can still run on the A8-5600K (if barely) thanks to FSR. I’m running ESO at 1920x1080 with the low quality preset, and FSR set to Quality. Framerate isn’t impressive and often stays below 20 FPS. CPU bandwidth can often reach into the high 4 GB/s range, though that often occurs when loading in or accessing hub areas with many players around. GPU-side bandwidth demands are lower compared to the two prior benchmarks, and total bandwidth stays under 16 GB/s. RawTherapee converts camera raw files into standard image formats (i.e. JPEG). Here, I’m processing 45 megapixel raw files from a Nikon D850. RawTherapee only uses the CPU for image processing, so most DRAM traffic is observed through the XBAR, coming from the CPU. The iGPU still uses a bit of bandwidth for display refreshes and perhaps the occasional GPU-accelerated UI feature. In this case, I have the iGPU driving a pair of 1920x1080 60 Hz displays. Darktable is another raw conversion program. Unlike RawTherapee, Darktable can offload some parts of its image processing pipeline to the GPU. It’s likely the kind of application AMD hoped would become popular and showcase its iGPU prowess. With Darktable, Trinity’s Northbridge handles a mix of traffic from the CPU and iGPU, depending on what the image processing pipeline demands. IO to memory traffic also becomes more than a rounding error, which is notable because that’s how “Onion” traffic is counted. Other IO traffic like SSD reads can also be counted at the XBAR, but that should be insignificant in this workload. Final Words In Trinity’s era, powerful iGPUs were an obvious way for AMD to make use of their ATI acquisition and carve out a niche, despite falling behind Intel on the CPU field. However AMD’s interconnect wasn’t ideal for integrating a GPU. The “Onion” and “Garlic” links were a compromise solution that worked around the Northbridge’s limitations. With these links, Trinity doesn’t get the full advantages that an iGPU should intuitively enjoy. Zero-copy behavior is possible, and should work better than doing so with a contemporary discrete GPU setup. But both the CPU and GPU face lower memory performance when accessing the other’s memory space. Awkwardly for AMD, Intel had a more integrated iGPU setup with Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge. Intel’s iGPU sat on a ring bus along with CPU cores and L3 cache. That naturally made it a client of the L3 cache, and unified the CPU and GPU memory access paths at that point. Several years would pass before AMD created their own flexible interconnect where the CPU and GPU could both use a unified, coherent memory path without compromise. Fortunately for AMD, Intel didn’t have a big iGPU to pair with Ivy Bridge. Trinity’s interconnect may be awkward, but its weaknesses don’t show for graphics workloads. The iGPU can happily gobble up bandwidth over the “Garlic” link, and can do so without destroying CPU-side memory latency. Trinity does tend to generate a lot of DRAM traffic, thanks to a relatively small 512 KB read-only L2 texture cache on the GPU side, and no L3 on the CPU side. Bandwidth hungry workloads like FF14’s Heavensward benchmark can lean heavily on the chip’s DDR3-1866 setup. But even in that workload, there’s a bit of bandwidth to spare. Trinity’s crossbars and separate coherent/non-coherent iGPU links may lack elegance and sophistication compared to modern designs but it was sufficient to let AMD get started with powerful iGPUs in the early 2010s.
