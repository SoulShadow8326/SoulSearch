Described by Einstein as the most important woman in the history of mathematics, she proved Noether's first and second theorems , fundamental in mathematical physics . Noether's first theorem explains the connection between symmetry and conservation laws . She also developed theories of rings , fields , and algebras . Born to a Jewish family in Erlangen ; her work in Germany, principally at Göttingen University , came at a time when women were largely excluded from academia there. In 1933, Germany's Nazi government dismissed Jews from university positions , and Noether moved to the U.S., teaching at Bryn Mawr College and at the Institute for Advanced Study . Noether was generous with her ideas and is credited with several lines of research published by others, even in fields far removed from her main work, such as algebraic topology .

It can be found along the coasts of western Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, in shallow, tidal waters with a bed of mud, sand or gravel. The worm is 10 to 25 centimetres (4 to 10 inches) in length, with its body divided into 100 to 600 small segments . The head has two fans of 8 to 45 feathery radioles arising from fleshy, semi-circular lobes. The body is mostly grey-green while the radioles are brown, red or purple with darker bands. This group of S.&#160;pavonina worms was photographed with a short-snouted seahorse in a protected marine natural area near Porto Cesareo , Italy.

I emailed dreamwidth about this in the past and they say it&#x27;s something their upstream network host does and they cannot even fix it if their site users wanted to fix it.

Within the pages of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London , Faraday described this seemingly simple yet profoundly unique molecule. What set benzene apart, even in its earliest discovery, was its resistance to easy chemical classification. Its peculiar behaviour, such as its surprising stability despite being highly unsaturated, hinted at a deeper mystery that would not be fully resolved until the mid-19th century with the proposal of its cyclic structure. Benzene’s physical properties only added to its mystique. This colourless liquid emitted a faintly sweet, intoxicating aroma – a hallmark of aromatic compounds. With a boiling point of 80.1°C, it was volatile and highly flammable, making it both a chemical curiosity and a potential industrial tool. Early chemists were captivated by its ability to dissolve fats, oils and other nonpolar substances, which made it a valuable solvent for experimentation and industrial processes. Yet, it was benzene’s chemical properties – its reactivity and stability – that would become the cornerstone of an entire branch of organic chemistry: aromatic compounds. Today, benzene is everywhere, interwoven into the structures of more complex molecules that enhance our daily lives in fields as diverse as health, energy, advanced materials, electronics, food, dyes and biotechnology. This humble molecule opened the doors to a vast universe of aromatic compounds and an endless array of applications that have redefined our world. Stability and tunability Following benzene’s legacy came polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a fascinating class of organic molecules composed of fused benzene rings. These structures not only preserve benzene’s aromatic stability, thanks to their electron delocalisation, but also exhibit unique electronic and optical properties determined by their size and arrangement. While smaller PAHs, like naphthalene and anthracene, had been characterised in the 19th century, the discovery of larger, more complex systems unveiled entirely new and surprising properties – from discrete energy levels in simpler molecules to semiconducting behaviours in larger systems like pentacene. The synthesis and study of these compounds paved the way for nanographenes, opening new dimensions in chemistry and materials science. Through meticulous control over their molecular structures, researchers have learned to design advanced materials with tunable properties, such as electron conductivity, fluorescence, chirality and chemical reactivity. This painstaking precision highlights the intrinsic beauty of chemistry at its most fundamental level, an art of exactitude that continues to push the boundaries of possibility. A landmark achievement in this journey was the discovery of hexabenzocoronene (HBC), in 1958. This molecule, composed of 42 carbon atoms forming 13 hexagonal rings in a perfectly flat structure, remained the largest fully characterised polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon for decades. Yet the creativity of organic chemistry knows no bounds. Klaus Müllen, a pioneer in the exploration of nanographenes, succeeded in 2002 in synthesising a remarkable structure formed by 222 carbon atoms with a diameter of 3nm, demonstrating the immense potential of organic synthesis to construct tailor-made graphene molecules. Graphene stands out as the ultimate expression of benzene’s versatility The fusion of benzene rings has given rise to some of the most remarkable materials in modern science, including fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. Fullerenes, often referred to as buckyballs , are spherical molecules composed entirely of carbon atoms arranged in a pattern of hexagons and pentagons, resembling a molecular soccer ball. These structures, discovered in 1985, owe their stability and symmetry to the aromaticity derived from benzene-like rings. Similarly, carbon nanotubes – long, cylindrical structures composed of fused aromatic rings – have captivated scientists with their extraordinary strength, flexibility and electrical conductivity. Both fullerenes and nanotubes exemplify the limitless potential of carbon chemistry, with benzene as the foundational building block. Among these innovations, graphene stands out as the ultimate expression of benzene’s versatility. This two-dimensional material, consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, is essentially a sheet of fused benzene rings. Graphene’s remarkable properties – its transparency, strength, flexibility and electrical conductivity – have earned it the title of a ‘gift of gods’. Graphene, like benzene before it, has the power to revolutionise multiple fields, from electronics and energy storage to medicine and materials science. Beyond its scientific impact, benzene holds a special place in education. Generations of high school and university students have been introduced to the elegance of its structure and the profound mystery surrounding its stability. The study of benzene serves as an accessible entry point for understanding broader concepts like aromaticity, resonance and molecular orbitals. By celebrating the bicentennial of its discovery, we honour not only the legacy of Faraday but also the enduring role of benzene in inspiring curiosity, innovation and the next generation of chemists. To celebrate the 200th anniversary of benzene’s discovery and its extraordinary legacy, the Royal Society of Chemistry will release a thematic special issue, uniting several RSC journals in a collaborative tribute to benzene’s unparalleled influence. This special issue, edited by Ben Feringa and Nazario Martín, will illuminate the enduring relevance of benzene by exploring its far-reaching legacy in carbon-based systems, from the fundamental concepts of aromaticity and antiaromaticity to groundbreaking research on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), molecular nanographenes (via both top-down and bottom-up approaches), graphene and its derivatives, carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. It will also delve into cutting-edge developments from (anti)aromatic compounds synthesised through on-surface methodologies to benzene-based molecular machines.

How were chemists in the early 19th century able to determine benzene must be highly unsaturated without knowing its structure? Did they simply combust it and measure the amount of water vapor and carbon dioxide produced? reply jcranmer 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] There&#x27;s a two step-process to stochiometry. The first step, as people have elaborated below, is combust the compound and measure the weights of various oxides, which (after the atomic masses of the relevant elements were settled around the 1820s) lets you work out the empirical formula of an unknown molecule. For benzene, this would tell you that there is 1 C : 1 H, but this doesn&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s C₄H₄ or C₆H₆ or C₁₁₁H₁₁₁. The second step is to determine the molar mass of your compound, which requires finding something that depends on the amount of substance but not the mass directly. (In modern times, this is primarily mass spec). Back in the 19th century, this is probably abusing the ideal gas law, which lets you compute the number of moles in a gas given the pressure, temperature, and volume of a vessel. Combine this with the mass of that container, and you know how much a mole weighs. If you get out, say, 77g&#x2F;mol, and you know that the ratio is 1 C : 1 H, well, the only formula that makes sense is C₆H₆ (which should ideally have 78g&#x2F;mol, but you might not get the right answer for various experimental reasons). reply isoprophlex 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] What these early chemists accomplished with, to our eyes, extremely crude methods is astounding.

A huge amount of chemical reactions are most convenient to do in a liquid, a liquid that can dissolve the materials you&#x27;re working with. That&#x27;s a solvent. Benzene can dissolve a lot of things, including some that are really hard to dissolve otherwise. So it can be used for a huge variety of reactions, but as the sort background player that you might not pay attention to unless you can&#x27;t have it. It&#x27;s a little like asking &quot;what are the uses of water in chemistry&quot;, where you&#x27;re tempted to answer, &quot;um, everything?&quot; Not quite, but not that far off either.

More than half of the entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene, a precursor to styrene, which is used to make polymers and plastics like polystyrene. Some 20% of the benzene production is used to manufacture cumene, which is needed to produce phenol and acetone for resins and adhesives. Cyclohexane consumes around 10% of the world&#x27;s benzene production; it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers, which are processed into textiles and engineering plastics. Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, explosives, and pesticides. It&#x27;s an important feedstock in the chemical industry but it is no longer used directly in household products. It used to be common in solvent&#x2F;glue&#x2F;grease remover formulations before the health hazard was widely appreciated. reply pcthrowaway 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] Benzene was what made decaf coffee possible in 1905 (if can you consider this a productive use). The beans were soaked in warm water then rinsed (several times?) with benzene, which was able to extract the majority of caffeine, and presumably not much else affecting the flavour. It would have the benefit of evaporating with no residue given enough time, but due to the possibility of residue and the difficulty of working with it safely, decaffeination processes have since moved on. reply andygeorge 4 hours ago | prev | next [–] I was a kid when there was a Benzene spill up where I lived at the time (Duluth, MN).

As someone passionate about renewables, I was actually excited to go see the underbelly of one of the most evil companies. I also wanted to learn more about the energy industry and the maze of pipes that looked like steel spaghetti to me.. it was also always in the back of my mind that those student loans wouldn&#x27;t pay for themselves. I started off in IT but eventually was fortunate enough to land a job focusing on their developing new products with other portfolio companies that focused on addressing challenges in O&amp;G. One of the things I prided myself on was spending time, boots on the ground, with the people who were doing the day to day work and learning about what there problems were. This included a lot of escorted trips through the plant learning about the chemical processes as well as work processes, etc. One of the things I had picked up on was how nasty benzene was, this was widely acknowledged at the time by the company, and not in the typical window dressing sort of way that these things are often glossed over. Well long story short, one day I&#x27;m standing on top of grating resting above a concrete pit coming off a refining unit while they are using a truck sized vacuum to extract the liquid (guess what the truck is called), which is told is an every day occurance. Standing a few feet above the liquid, it looks like dirty water. As an afterthought, I ask &quot;what is this liquid?&quot;. &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s just benzine&quot; ... taps 4 gas meter that&#x27;s supposed to keep me safe from anything &quot;well isn&#x27;t this thing supposed to go off?&quot; &quot;Not all the time&quot; Never did that again. I was surprised it was treated so nonchalantly, but when your job is to deal with dangerous stuff day in and day out, I guess certain things don&#x27;t raise alarms. I, of course, didn&#x27;t ask what concentration it was, etc., I just filed a few lessons away. But it&#x27;s always stuck with me how routine some of this incredibly dangerous work can seem, and how difficult it must be to differentiate types of danger when they&#x27;re not things that are obviously dangerous, such as having your finger chopped off, or worse, ruining a nice set of steel toes. Anyway, that&#x27;s my benzine story. reply jasonthorsness 4 hours ago | prev | next [–] Seattle’s Gas Works Park has some strange equipment to address the benzene contamination.

On the east side of the Park, south of the Play Barn the groundwater is contaminated with benzene. An interim action removed a benzene containing LNAPL that had been discovered during site investigation. The remedy chosen for benzene was an air-sparging&#x2F;soil vapor extraction (AS&#x2F;SVE). The AS&#x2F;SVE system covers approximately 1.5 acres of the Park. It is unnoticeable to Park users except for a small equipment box near the Towers. . An action level was calculated based on MTCA Method B surface water criteria and a dilution attenuation factor (DAF). The calculation used to set the DAF and the action level for benzene is given in appendix 1. 4.1 Benzene. Benzene concentration in the compliance well OBS-1 remains below the action level but above the method B groundwater cleanup level. The remedy, therefore, remains effective.

The chem labs were not nearly as bad because they had better ventilation to begin with. Plus before my time benzene had also been prized as high-octane motor fuel for early cars back when it was obtained for sale naturally by removal from aromatic crude oils in some refineries. This was not such pure benzene however the significant percentage of impurities at the dispenser acted with an &quot;antifreeze&quot; effect and it handled no differently than regular gasoline below 32 degrees F. Pure benzene freezes at about 40 degrees F, and that pure of a hydrocarbon ended up being too expensive to burn anyway.

So it doesn&#x27;t fit in group 2,3,4. So it goes in group one. For scales that measure exposure needed for negative outcomes, most of the time these are for chemicals that are&#x2F;have been used in work environments. So EPA (and probably OSHA) has a threshold scale for benzene, but not for tobacco cigarettes. Most of the time, there aren&#x27;t MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets) for consumer products like cigarettes.

Did they simply combust it and measure the amount of water vapor and carbon dioxide produced? reply jcranmer 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] There&#x27;s a two step-process to stochiometry. The first step, as people have elaborated below, is combust the compound and measure the weights of various oxides, which (after the atomic masses of the relevant elements were settled around the 1820s) lets you work out the empirical formula of an unknown molecule. For benzene, this would tell you that there is 1 C : 1 H, but this doesn&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s C₄H₄ or C₆H₆ or C₁₁₁H₁₁₁. The second step is to determine the molar mass of your compound, which requires finding something that depends on the amount of substance but not the mass directly. (In modern times, this is primarily mass spec). Back in the 19th century, this is probably abusing the ideal gas law, which lets you compute the number of moles in a gas given the pressure, temperature, and volume of a vessel. Combine this with the mass of that container, and you know how much a mole weighs. If you get out, say, 77g&#x2F;mol, and you know that the ratio is 1 C : 1 H, well, the only formula that makes sense is C₆H₆ (which should ideally have 78g&#x2F;mol, but you might not get the right answer for various experimental reasons). reply isoprophlex 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] What these early chemists accomplished with, to our eyes, extremely crude methods is astounding.

A huge amount of chemical reactions are most convenient to do in a liquid, a liquid that can dissolve the materials you&#x27;re working with. That&#x27;s a solvent. Benzene can dissolve a lot of things, including some that are really hard to dissolve otherwise. So it can be used for a huge variety of reactions, but as the sort background player that you might not pay attention to unless you can&#x27;t have it. It&#x27;s a little like asking &quot;what are the uses of water in chemistry&quot;, where you&#x27;re tempted to answer, &quot;um, everything?&quot; Not quite, but not that far off either.

More than half of the entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene, a precursor to styrene, which is used to make polymers and plastics like polystyrene. Some 20% of the benzene production is used to manufacture cumene, which is needed to produce phenol and acetone for resins and adhesives. Cyclohexane consumes around 10% of the world&#x27;s benzene production; it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers, which are processed into textiles and engineering plastics. Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, explosives, and pesticides. It&#x27;s an important feedstock in the chemical industry but it is no longer used directly in household products. It used to be common in solvent&#x2F;glue&#x2F;grease remover formulations before the health hazard was widely appreciated. reply pcthrowaway 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] Benzene was what made decaf coffee possible in 1905 (if can you consider this a productive use). The beans were soaked in warm water then rinsed (several times?) with benzene, which was able to extract the majority of caffeine, and presumably not much else affecting the flavour. It would have the benefit of evaporating with no residue given enough time, but due to the possibility of residue and the difficulty of working with it safely, decaffeination processes have since moved on. reply andygeorge 4 hours ago | prev | next [–] I was a kid when there was a Benzene spill up where I lived at the time (Duluth, MN).

As someone passionate about renewables, I was actually excited to go see the underbelly of one of the most evil companies. I also wanted to learn more about the energy industry and the maze of pipes that looked like steel spaghetti to me.. it was also always in the back of my mind that those student loans wouldn&#x27;t pay for themselves. I started off in IT but eventually was fortunate enough to land a job focusing on their developing new products with other portfolio companies that focused on addressing challenges in O&amp;G. One of the things I prided myself on was spending time, boots on the ground, with the people who were doing the day to day work and learning about what there problems were. This included a lot of escorted trips through the plant learning about the chemical processes as well as work processes, etc. One of the things I had picked up on was how nasty benzene was, this was widely acknowledged at the time by the company, and not in the typical window dressing sort of way that these things are often glossed over. Well long story short, one day I&#x27;m standing on top of grating resting above a concrete pit coming off a refining unit while they are using a truck sized vacuum to extract the liquid (guess what the truck is called), which is told is an every day occurance. Standing a few feet above the liquid, it looks like dirty water. As an afterthought, I ask &quot;what is this liquid?&quot;. &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s just benzine&quot; ... taps 4 gas meter that&#x27;s supposed to keep me safe from anything &quot;well isn&#x27;t this thing supposed to go off?&quot; &quot;Not all the time&quot; Never did that again. I was surprised it was treated so nonchalantly, but when your job is to deal with dangerous stuff day in and day out, I guess certain things don&#x27;t raise alarms. I, of course, didn&#x27;t ask what concentration it was, etc., I just filed a few lessons away. But it&#x27;s always stuck with me how routine some of this incredibly dangerous work can seem, and how difficult it must be to differentiate types of danger when they&#x27;re not things that are obviously dangerous, such as having your finger chopped off, or worse, ruining a nice set of steel toes. Anyway, that&#x27;s my benzine story. reply jasonthorsness 4 hours ago | prev | next [–] Seattle’s Gas Works Park has some strange equipment to address the benzene contamination.

On the east side of the Park, south of the Play Barn the groundwater is contaminated with benzene. An interim action removed a benzene containing LNAPL that had been discovered during site investigation. The remedy chosen for benzene was an air-sparging&#x2F;soil vapor extraction (AS&#x2F;SVE). The AS&#x2F;SVE system covers approximately 1.5 acres of the Park. It is unnoticeable to Park users except for a small equipment box near the Towers. . An action level was calculated based on MTCA Method B surface water criteria and a dilution attenuation factor (DAF). The calculation used to set the DAF and the action level for benzene is given in appendix 1. 4.1 Benzene. Benzene concentration in the compliance well OBS-1 remains below the action level but above the method B groundwater cleanup level. The remedy, therefore, remains effective.

The chem labs were not nearly as bad because they had better ventilation to begin with. Plus before my time benzene had also been prized as high-octane motor fuel for early cars back when it was obtained for sale naturally by removal from aromatic crude oils in some refineries. This was not such pure benzene however the significant percentage of impurities at the dispenser acted with an &quot;antifreeze&quot; effect and it handled no differently than regular gasoline below 32 degrees F. Pure benzene freezes at about 40 degrees F, and that pure of a hydrocarbon ended up being too expensive to burn anyway. IIRC it can really make a lawn mower cut taller grass than premium gasoline, and scientifically it does have about 100 antiknock rating so it&#x27;s no surprise. reply k__ 24 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] &quot;Often still known by its archaic name Benzol&quot; In German, that&#x27;s the regular name, haha. reply chasil 0 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] That would actually imply that an OH group replaced one of the hydrogens, forming an alcohol. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alcohol_(chemistry) So Benzol is not benzyl alcohol. trebligdivad 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] The article talks about the wonders of bucky balls and nanotubes - does anyone know what useful stuff has come out of those yet?

IARC Grouping Levels: Group 1 - We are certain this will cause cancer Group 2 - Probable it causes cancer Group 3 - We don&#x27;t know if it causes cancer Group 4 - Unlikely to cause cancer So when looking at something like tobacco smoking, we have lots of evidence that people who smoke get lung cancer. So it doesn&#x27;t fit in group 2,3,4. So it goes in group one. For scales that measure exposure needed for negative outcomes, most of the time these are for chemicals that are&#x2F;have been used in work environments. So EPA (and probably OSHA) has a threshold scale for benzene, but not for tobacco cigarettes. Most of the time, there aren&#x27;t MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets) for consumer products like cigarettes.

At one point I was paying over $400 a month for hosting these in the cloud. Last year I moved all my stuff to Hetzner. For a 4GB machine, the cost of various providers: Heroku = $260 Fly.io = $65 Render = $85 Hetzner = $4 (This problem gets a lot worse when you need &gt; 4GB) The only downside of using Hetzner is that there isn’t a super straightforward way to do stuff like: - DNS management &#x2F; SSL certificate management - Team management - Github integration But I figured it should be easy to quickly build something like Heroku for my Hetzner instance. Turns out it was a bit harder than expected, but after a year, I’ve made some good progress The best part of Canine, is that it also makes it trivial to host any helm chart, which is available for basically any open source project, so everything from databases (e.g. Postgres, Redis), to random stuff like torrent tracking servers, VPN’s endpoints, etc. Open source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;czhu12&#x2F;canine Cloud hosted version is: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;canine.sh vanillax 5 minutes ago | next [–] Nit pick.

Unlike traditional Transformer designs, which suffer from quadratic memory and computation overload due to the nature of the self attention mechanism, our model avoids token to token attention entirely. Instead, it combines the following complementary components: State Space blocks (inspired by S4) that learn continuous time convolution kernels and scale near linearly with sequence length, Multi Resolution Convolution layers that capture local context at different dilation levels, a lightweight Recurrent Supervisor to maintain a global hidden state across sequential chunks, and Retrieval Augmented External Memory that stores and retrieves high-level chunk embeddings without reintroducing quadratic operations.

I suspect you could make the tracing SDK 2x faster with some cleverness. The main tricks are: - Use a faster time.Now(). Go does a fair bit of work to convert to the Go epoch. - Use atomics instead of a mutex. I sent a PR, but the reviewer caught correctness issues. Atomics are subtle and tricky. - Directly marshal protos instead of reflection with a hand-rolled library or with https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VictoriaMetrics&#x2F;easyproto . The gold standard is how TiDB implemented tracing ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pingcap.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-we-trace-a-kv-database-with... ). Since Go purposefully (and reasonably) doesn&#x27;t currently provide a comparable abstraction for thread-local storage, we can&#x27;t implement similar tricks like special-casing when a trace is modified on a single thread. reply rastignack 18 minutes ago | parent | next [–] Would the sync.Pool trick mentionned here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypermode.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-ristretto-high-perf-g... help ? It’s lossy but might be a good compromise. reply malkia 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] There is an effort to use arrow format for metrics too - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;open-telemetry&#x2F;otel-arrow - but no client that exports directly to it yet. reply reactordev 57 minutes ago | prev | next [–] Mmmmmmm, the last 8 months of my life wrapped into a blog post but with an ad on the end. Excellent. Basically the same findings as me, my team, and everyone else in the space. Not being sarcastic at all, it’s tricky. I like that the article called out eBPF and why you would want to disable it for speed but recommends caution. I kept hearing from executives a “single pane of glass” marketing speak and I kept my mouth shut about how that isn’t feasible across the entire organization. Needless to say, they didn’t like that non-answer and so I was canned. What an engineer cared about is different from organization&#x2F;business metrics and often the two were confused. I wrote a lot of great otel receivers though. VMware, Veracode, Hashicorp Vault, GitLab, Jenkins, Jira, and the platforms itself. reply phillipcarter 50 minutes ago | parent | next [–] &gt; I kept hearing from executives a “single pane of glass” marketing speak It&#x27;s really unfortunate that Observability vendors lean into this to reinforce it too. What the execs usually care about is engineering workflows consolidating and allowing teams to all &quot;speak the same language&quot; in terms of data, analysis workflows, visualizations, runbooks, etc. This goal is admirable, but nearly impossible to achieve because it&#x27;s the exact same problem as solving &quot;we are aligned organizationally&quot;, which no organization ever is. That doesn&#x27;t mean progress can&#x27;t be made, but it&#x27;s always far more complicated than they would like. reply reactordev 47 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] For sure, it’s the ultimate nirvana. Let me know when an organization gets there. :) reply Thaxll 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] Logging, metrics and traces are not free, especially if you turn them on at every requests. Tracing every http 200 at 10k req&#x2F;sec is not something you should be doing, at that rate you should sample 200 ( 1% or so ) and trace all the errors. reply anonzzzies 3 hours ago | parent | next [–] A very small % of startups gets anywhere near that traffic so why give them angst? Most people can just do this without any issues and learn from it and a tiny fraction shouldn&#x27;t. reply cogman10 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Having high req&#x2F;s isn&#x27;t as big a negative as it once was. Especially if you are using http2 or http3. Designing APIs which cause a high number of requests and spit out a low amount of data can be quite legitimate. It allows for better scaling and capacity planning vs having single calls that take a large amount of time and return large amounts of data. In the old http1 days, it was a bad thing because a single connection could only service 1 request at a time. Getting any sort of concurrency or high request rates require many connections (which had a large amount of overhead due to the way tcp functions). We&#x27;ve moved past that. reply williamdclt 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] 10k&#x2F;s across multiple services is reached quickly even at startup scale. In my previous company (startup), we’d use Otel everywhere and we definitely needed sampling for cost reasons (1&#x2F;30 iirc). And that was using a much cheaper provider than Datadog reply orochimaaru 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Metrics are usually minimal overheard. Traces need to be sampled. Logs need to be sampled at error&#x2F;critical levels. You also need to be able to dynamically change sampling and log levels. 100% traces are a mess. I didn’t see where he setup sampling. reply phillipcarter 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] The post didn&#x27;t cover sampling, which indeed, significantly reduces overhead in OTel because the spans that aren&#x27;t sampled aren&#x27;t ever created, when you head sample at the SDK level. This is more of a concern when doing tail-based sampling only, wherein you will want to trace each request and offload to a sidecar so that export concerns are handled outside your app. And then it routes to a sampler elsewhere in your infrastructure. FWIW at my former employer we had some fairly loose guidelines for folks around sampling: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.honeycomb.io&#x2F;manage-data-volume&#x2F;sample&#x2F;guidelin... There&#x27;s outliers, but the general idea is that there&#x27;s also a high cost to implementing sampling (especially for nontrivial stuff), and if your volume isn&#x27;t terribly high then you&#x27;ll probably eat a lot more in time than paying for the extra data you may not necessarily need. reply jhoechtl 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] I am relatively new to the topic. In the sample code of the OP there is no logging right? It&#x27;s metrics and traces but no logging. How is logging in OTel? reply coxley 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] The OTel SDK has always been much worse to use than Prometheus for metrics — including higher overhead. I prefer to only use it for tracing for that reason. reply vanschelven 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] The article never really explains what eBPF is -- AFAIU, it’s a kernel feature that lets you trace syscalls and network events without touching your app code. Low overhead, good for metrics, but not exactly transparent. It’s the umpteenth OTEL-critical article on the front page of HN this month alone... I have to say I share the sentiment but probably for different reasons. My take is quite the opposite: most value is precisely in the application (code) level so you definetly should instrument... and then focus on Errors over &quot;general observability&quot;[0] [0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bugsink.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;track-errors-first&#x2F; reply nikolay_sivko 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] I&#x27;m the author. I wouldn’t say the post is critical of OTEL. I just wanted to measure the overhead, that’s all. Benchmarks shouldn’t be seen as critique. Quite the opposite, we can only improve things if we’ve measured them first. reply politician 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I don&#x27;t want to take away from your point, and yet... if anyone lacks background knowledge these days the relevant context is just an LLM prompt away. reply vanschelven 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] It was always &quot;a search away&quot; but on the _web_ one might as well use... A hyperlink reply dmoy 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] Not on original topic, but: I definitely prefer having graphs put the unit at least on the axis, if not in the individual axis labels directly. I.e. instead of having a graph titled &quot;latency, seconds&quot; at the top and then way over on the left have an unlabeled axis with &quot;5m, 10m, 15m, 20m&quot; ticks... I&#x27;d rather have title &quot;latency&quot; and either &quot;seconds&quot; on the left, or, given the confusion between &quot;5m = 5 minutes&quot; or &quot;5m = 5 milli[seconds]&quot;, just have it explicitly labeled on each tick: 5ms, 10ms, ... Way, way less likely to confuse someone when the units are right on the number, instead of floating way over in a different section of the graph reply otterley 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] Out of curiosity, does Go&#x27;s built-in pprof yield different results? The nice thing about Go is that you don&#x27;t need an eBPF module to get decent profiling. Also, CPU and memory instrumentation is built into the Linux kernel already. reply jeffbee 3 hours ago | prev [–] I feel like this is a lesson that unfortunately did not escape Google, even though a lot of these open systems came from Google or ex-Googlers. The overhead of tracing, logs, and metrics needs to be ultra-low. But the (mis)feature whereby a trace span can be sampled post hoc means that you cannot have a nil tracer that does nothing on unsampled traces, because it could become sampled later. And the idea that if a metric exists it must be centrally collected is totally preposterous, makes everything far too expensive when all a developer wants is a metric that costs nothing in the steady state but can be collected when needed. reply mamidon 1 hour ago | parent [–] How would you handle the case where you want to trace 100% of errors? Presumably you don&#x27;t know a trace is an error until after you&#x27;ve executed the thing and paid the price. reply phillipcarter 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] This is correct. It&#x27;s a seemingly simple desire -- &quot;always capture whenever there&#x27;s a request with an error!&quot; -- but the overhead needed to set that up gets complex. And then you start heading down the path of &quot;well THESE business conditions are more important than THOSE business conditions!&quot; and before you know it, you&#x27;ve got a nice little tower of sampling cards assembled. It&#x27;s still worth it, just a hefty tax at times, and often the right solution is to just pay for more compute and data so that your engineers are spending less time on these meta-level concerns. reply jeffbee 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev [–] I wouldn&#x27;t. &quot;Trace contains an error&quot; is a hideously bad criterion for sampling. If you have some storage subsystem where you always hedge&#x2F;race reads to two replicas then cancel the request of the losing replica, then all of your traces will contain an error. It is a genuinely terrible feature. Local logging of error conditions is the way to go. And I mean local, not to a central, indexed log search engine; that&#x27;s also way too expensive. reply phillipcarter 1 hour ago | root | parent [–] I disagree that it&#x27;s a bad criterion. The case you describe is what sounds difficult, treating one error as part of normal operations and another as not. That should be considered its own kind of error or other form of response, and sampling decisions could take that into consideration (or not). reply jeffbee 38 minutes ago | root | parent [–] Another reason against inflating sampling rates on errors is: for system stability you never want to do more stuff during errors than you would normally do. Doing something more expensive during an error can cause your whole system, or elements of it, to latch into an unplanned operating point where they only have the capacity to do the expensive error path, and all of the traffic is throwing errors because of the resource starvation. reply Consider applying for YC's Fall 2025 batch!

Turso Login Open main menu Product Docs Customers Pricing Blog Schedule a call Follow us on X Join us on Discord Login Sign Up Jun 16, 2025 Working on databases from prison: How I got here, part 2. Preston Thorpe I&#x27;m very excited to announce that I have recently joined Turso as a software engineer. For many in the field, including myself, getting to work on databases and solve unique challenges with such a talented team would be a dream job, but it is that much more special to me because of my unusual and unlikely circumstances. As difficult as it might be to believe, I am currently incarcerated and I landed this job from my cell in state prison. If you don’t know me, let me tell you more about how I got here. # How I got here Nearly two years have passed since I published How I got here to my blog. That post was my first real contact with the outside world in years, as I&#x27;d been off all social media and the internet since 2017. The response and support I would receive from the tech community caught me completely off guard. A brief summary is that I&#x27;m currently serving prison time for poor decisions and lifestyle choices I made in my twenties, all related to drugs. Three years ago, I enrolled in a prison college program that came with the unique opportunity to access a computer with limited internet access. This immediately reignited a teenage love for programming and a lightbulb immediately lit up: that this would be my way out of the mess I had gotten myself into over the past 15 years. I quickly outgrew the curriculum, preferring instead to spend ~15+ hours a day on projects and open source contributions. Through fortunate timing and lots of hard work, I was selected to be one of the first participants in the Maine Dept of Correction’s remote work program, where residents who meet certain requirements are allowed to seek out remote employment opportunities. I landed a software engineering job at a startup called Unlocked Labs building education solutions for incarcerated learners, while contributing to open source on the side. After just a year, I was leading their development team. # Finding Turso: hacking on project Limbo Last December I was between side-projects and browsing Hacker News when I discovered Project Limbo, an effort by Turso to rewrite SQLite from scratch. I&#x27;d never worked on relational databases, but some experience with a cache had recently sparked an interest in storage engines. Luckily for me I saw that the project was fairly young with plenty of low hanging fruit to cut my teeth on. To put this entirely into perspective for some of you may be difficult, but in prison there isn’t exactly a whole lot to do and programming absolutely consumes my life. I either write code or manage Kubernetes clusters or other infrastructure for about 90 hours a week, and my only entertainment is a daily hour of tech/programming YouTube; mostly consisting of The Primeagen, whose story was a huge inspiration to me early on. Through Prime, I had known about Turso since the beginning and had watched several interviews with Glauber and Pekka discussing their Linux kernel backgrounds and talking about the concept of distributed, multi-tenant SQLite. These were folks I&#x27;d looked up to for years and definitely could not have imagined that I would eventually be in any position to be contributing meaningfully to such an ambitious project of theirs. So needless to say, for those first PR&#x27;s, just the thought of a kernel maintainer reviewing my code had made me quite nervous. Helping build Limbo quickly became my new obsession. I split my time between my job and diving deep into SQLite source code, academic papers on database internals, and Andy Pavlo&#x27;s CMU lectures. I was active on the Turso Discord but I don&#x27;t think I considered whether anyone was aware that one of the top contributors was doing so from a prison cell. My story and information are linked on my GitHub, but it&#x27;s subtle enough where you could miss it if you didn&#x27;t read the whole profile. A couple months later, I got a Discord message from Glauber introducing himself and asking if we could meet. In January, Glauber&#x27;s tweet about our interaction caught the attention of The Primeagen, and he ended up reading my blog post on his stream, bringing a whole lot of new attention to it. To this day I receive semi-regular emails either from developers, college kids or others who maybe have either gone through addiction or similar circumstances, or just want to reach out for advice on how to best start contributing to open source or optimize their learning path. # What&#x27;s Next I&#x27;m incredibly proud to be an example to others of how far hard work, determination and discipline will get you, and will be forever grateful for the opportunities given to me by the Maine Dept of Corrections to even be able to work hard in the first place, and to Unlocked Labs for giving me a chance and hiring me at a time when most assuredly no-one else would. I&#x27;m also incredibly proud to announce that I am now working for Turso full time, something I would never have dreamed would be possible just a few years ago, I&#x27;m very excited to be a part of the team and to get to help build the modern evolution of SQLite. Although some recent bad news from the court means that I won&#x27;t be coming home as early as my family and I had hoped, my only choice is to view this as a blessing and for the next 10 months, will instead just be able to continue to dedicate time and focus to advancing my career at such a level that just wouldn&#x27;t be possible otherwise. Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to reach out over the past couple years, to my team at Unlocked Labs, and especially my parents. Thanks to Turso for the opportunity and to all the other companies with fair chance hiring policies who believe that people deserve a second chance. This journey has been totally surreal and every day I am still in awe of how far my life has come from the life I lived even just a few years ago.

ZjsComponent is an example implementation of an approach to creating components and object instances that can be used purely from HTML. Unlike traditional approaches to components, the approach implemented by ZjsComponent does not require build-steps, transpiling, pre-compilation, any specific ecosystem or any other dependency. All that is required is that the browser can load and execute Javascript as needed by Web Components. ZjsComponent allows dynamic loading and isolation of HTML+JS fragments, offering developers a simple way to build reusable interfaces with ease. This approach is dependency-free, provides significant DOM and code isolation, and supports simple lifecycle hooks as well as traditional methods expected of an instance of a class.

The amazing thing about it is that it gives real jobs to prisoners that they can seamlessly continue after they get out of prison. Normally when you get out, it&#x27;s impossible to get a job, and the clock is ticking. This leads to desperation, which leads to bad behavior. There is a real risk of exploitation, but if it&#x27;s properly managed, remote work for prisoners is one of the most hopeful things I&#x27;ve heard about the prison system. It gives people purpose while there and an avenue to success once they&#x27;re out. reply larodi 0 minutes ago | parent | next [–] Wonder if they acquire the skills to break into systems, why would they choose not to do it in this crazy world out there? Particularly if somebody spends long time, or has spent so far. reply antihero 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] It&#x27;s amazing. Absolutely insane that people are incarcerated so long for non-violent drug crimes, though. Turso also looks really neat for small Payload sites. reply badc0ffee 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] &quot;Non-violent drug crimes&quot; brings to mind hippies selling weed or mushrooms. But this guy was selling carfentanil. I&#x27;m not saying he&#x27;s to blame for the opioid crisis turning street people into shambling zombies, clogging emergency services with overdoses, and causing death, but he certainly played a part. reply cortesoft 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] He played a lot smaller part than the Sackler family, who ran Purdue Pharma and pushed their drugs into communities. They killed a lot more people than this guy, and yet none of them are in jail. reply tux3 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] The Sacklers are comfortably above the law and that&#x27;s a bad thing, but that doesn&#x27;t make small time carfentanyl operations any less bad Evil is a threshold, it&#x27;s not a competition with limited spots Sometimes big crime families or notorious serial killers get away with it, but it doesn&#x27;t lower the threshold for anyone else It doesn&#x27;t make it any better that someone else is doing even worse.

I much prefer a society in which I can get away with some crimes to one where every crime is prosecuted. reply BeetleB 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Bush and his cronies resulted in the death of far more innocent people than your typical murderer. But we don&#x27;t stop sending murderers to prison just because Bush&#x2F;Cheney are not in prison. I&#x27;ve voted for drug legalization (including possession). However, that doesn&#x27;t mean that I condone all drug dealing behavior. reply e40 58 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Whataboutism. Selling the drug he was peddling kills people. Lots of people. This is not a “no victims” crime.

It is now 4 PM, about to clock out for the day because I gotta wait for CI run thats &gt;30m. I come back here and it&#x27;s still going on. This is #3 comment I see when I open HN, ensuing thread takes up two pages scrolls on 16&quot; MBP. It&#x27;s bad of me to write this because, well, who cares? Additionally, am I trying to litigate what other people comment? The root feeling driving me to express myself is a form of frustrated boredom -- rolling with that and verbalizing concretely, a bunch of people writing comments with the one thing they&#x27;re hyperfocusing on their record to drive a conclusion on their value as a person&#x2F;morality, and then people pointing out that&#x27;s not some moral absolute, asking for links, discussing the links... ...well, it&#x27;s all just clutter. Or YouTube comment-level discussion, unless we&#x27;re planning on relitigating every case he&#x27;s been involved in. This all would be better if it the kangaroo court stuff was confined to a thread with all of the evidence against him, so we didn&#x27;t have a bunch of weak cases, or if people didn&#x27;t treat this as an opportunity to be a drive by judge. Article def. ain&#x27;t about his crimes, and he ain&#x27;t saying he&#x27;s innocent or an angel. (and the idea that &quot;drug crimes&quot; implies &quot;hippie selling weed or psychedelics&quot; so calling them &quot;drug crimes&quot; is hiding the ball...where does that come from? Its especially dissonant b&#x2F;c you indicate the mere fact he sold an opiod is so bad that this guy is...bad? irredeemable? not worth discussing?...so presumably you care a lot about opiods, so presumably you know that&#x27;s whats driven drug crime the last, uh, decade or two?) reply badc0ffee 13 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; trying to make a definitive case on his...goodness? morality? Speaking for myself, I&#x27;m actually just discussing the idea that a non-violent crime like drug dealing necessarily deserves a light sentence in general. &gt; Sounds like a you thing It is a me thing. That&#x27;s why I said &quot;brings to mind&quot;. I&#x27;m a product of my time. I remember when weed and psychedelics meant demonization and heavy sentences, and it was absurd because those substances aren&#x27;t that dangerous. This is the context in which I&#x27;m accustomed to calling drug dealing a &quot;non-violent crime&quot;. So, I feel like I need to point out that things are not quite the same with deadly drugs like carfentanil. reply CobrastanJorji 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Oh absolutely. Voters always favor harsher punishments or making things worse for those already convicted of crimes. You never get any more votes by pushing for lower punishments for any crime or by doing anything to reduce recidivism. I suspect that a pretty solid litmus test for &quot;politician who is actually trying to make the world a better place&quot; based just on how they vote for lowering recidivism. reply tptacek 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I agree with you. This is a crazy high sentence (15-30). But worth nothing that the fact pattern behind it was also pretty crazy. reply ponector 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [5 more] [flagged] cycomanic 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] And you take personal responsibility if someone innocent is convicted? Once you have executed someone there is no coming back. Or are you saying you&#x27;re OK with some innocents being killed so you can save some money (taxes)? reply ponector 7 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] It takes 5-25 years is the USA to execute a person. Someone can argue what is worse: to live 20 more years in prison or to be executed. reply charcircuit 56 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt;Once you have executed someone there is no coming back. Once you&#x27;ve taken 10 years of someone&#x27;s life there is no giving that back either. As technology progresses the cost of recording evidence will go down which will help convict and prove the innocence of people. reply BriggyDwiggs42 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Sure, some people might say that. I’d say that’s also quite cruel, and that there might be a third option that’s better than both. reply ahahs 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Say that to the people he killed selling those drugs.

If we do change the penalties, the convictions will change too. I just wanted to point out that there is clear evidence that this individual was involved in at least one violent act, as is often the case with ‘non-violent drug convicts’. reply dfxm12 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Do participants get paid a real wage? reply glommer 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Preston was free to negotiate his pay with us, and we pay him a full salary.

Any time prisoners talk to someone on the outside, it&#x27;s a potential conduit for contraband or organized crime. reply Balinares 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The exact same is true of people working outside of prison. reply gbalduzzi 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I think it&#x27;s reasonable to assume an additional risk for people in prison. Even though the enrolled people are completely trustworthy, doing this prevents untrustworthy people to simulate interest in the program just to be able to contact the external world for illegal activities. reply Retric 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Not really, contraband includes many things that are completely legal for non prisoners to have like currency, phones, knives, or alcohol.

It’s more or less guaranteed that contraband will get into prisons if someone is willing to pay for it. Thus the rules around no cash or phones for prisoners. Inmates are treated very differently by the legal system than regular people. Thirteenth Amendment: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States” reply snickerdoodle12 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] You can also do that via a butt phone, which are everywhere. reply Retric 10 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] That heavily depends on the facility. Phones aren’t that difficult to track down as a radio device, but such efforts are rare. newswasboring 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] People working outside pay rent. From a third to upto half their salary. reply conductr 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I disagree. The cut should support the program itself and then further offset taxpayer expenses related to housing, feeding, and caring for the prisoner. I could even see a case for taking it as a way of ensuring it was saved and returned at release. reply franga2000 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Fuck no! Lowering the cost of keeping people in prison would make it even easier for the government to lock people up for smaller crimes and with bigger sentences. It&#x27;s even worse with the privatised prison system that the US has. They already know the &quot;market price&quot; (what the government is willing to spend) so adding &quot;free money&quot; into the equation just makes it easier for them to raise prices and end up pocketing even more money than they already do. Framing it as offsetting the cost would also make it very easy to increase the cut, bit by bit, until it gets to a truly unreasonable level. And since the person is already in prison and we have to pay for them no matter what, why would they choose to work if the deal is so bad? reply dfxm12 52 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] It&#x27;s even worse with the privatised prison system that the US has. This is a state by state thing. FWIW in this case, ME doesn&#x27;t have private prisons. I don&#x27;t bring this up to imply everything related to their cut is on the up and up, however, I believe Maine is very much incentivized to make this a useful program in terms of keeping people from returning to jail (as opposed to squeezing every dollar from the prisoners). reply bryanrasmussen 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &quot;No cut&quot; is reasonable, but also &quot;Some cut&quot; is reasonable. However while arguing that &quot;no cut&quot; should be mandatory is reasonable, given that &quot;no cut&quot; would itself be reasonable, it is probably not pragmatic. Therefore in order to best support this kind of thing one should determine exactly how much &quot;some cut&quot; should be. reply osigurdson 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Isn&#x27;t this largely just a one off situation that happened to work out? I doubt there will be legions of prisoners working remotely. If that future did come to be, it would be rather dystopian imo. reply psunavy03 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] More dystopian than people in prison not being able to prepare themselves for a life outside? reply bryanrasmussen 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] if, right now, it is not dystopian, then there is no reason to say it would inevitably be dystopian if there were multiple occurrences, although sure, I expect it probably would be considering what the world is like. Of course I am the last person who one would expect to say it but - there is always hope. reply hashstring 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Why would it not be reasonable? reply hildolfr 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Google feeds staff members and provides rest areas , why are they paid? reply borski 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] The government takes a cut then too, both from the employer and employer, in the form of taxes. reply Ray20 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] For not going to work for competitors. reply mp05 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Don&#x27;t you suppose that it&#x27;s &quot;fair&quot; to request compensation for the room and board if the person is making a &quot;fair&quot; wage? reply BlarfMcFlarf 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] No. Prisons should cost society money.

I hope the developer&#x27;s life continues on this new trajectory. reply lo_zamoyski 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This sounds good. It is important that we recognize all of the purposes of punishment instead of overemphasizing one or neglecting the other. Punishment has three ends: retribution, rehabilitation, and deterrence. It is important that you pay for your crime for the sake of justice; it is charitable and prudent to rehabilitate the criminal, satisfying the corrective end of punishment; and would-be criminals must be given tangible evidence of what awaits them if they choose to indulge an evil temptation, thus acting as a deterrent. In our systems today, we either neglect correction, leaving people to rot in prison or endanger them with recidivism by throwing them back onto the streets with no correction, or we take an attitude of false compassion toward the perp by failing to inflict adequate justice, incidentally failing the deterrent end in the process. reply HappMacDonald 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Punishment has three ends: retribution, rehabilitation, and deterrence. One might argue a fourth end as well: removal. When people talk about &quot;cleaning up the streets&quot; they don&#x27;t mean causing ruffians to clean up their act, what they refer to is removing the ruffians entirely. To &quot;someplace else&quot;. To &quot;Not in my backyard&quot;. Out of sight, out of mind as is often said. For profit prisons may view prisoners as cheap labor or levy bait, but for the voting public who gets no cut of that action the real inducement starts and ends with &quot;make the problem go away&quot;. Sweep human beings we do not know how to cohabitate with under a rug. Retribution may appeal to those directly wronged, or to the minority of sadists in a population. Deterrence is oft admired, but few honestly believe it&#x27;s really possible given that harsh sentences never seem to cause crime to go to zero (sensationalism-driven media that magnifies every mole-hill notwithstanding) and that repeat offenses outnumber first offenses. Rehabilitation appeals to those with compassion, though nobody has a clear bead on how to actually land that plane with more than the lowest hanging fruit of only-slightly-off-course offenders. So I think the real elephant in the room is that people want&#x2F;demand&#x2F;rely upon removal. reply Ray20 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt;harsh sentences never seem to cause crime to go to zero Harsh sentences work great when used with the inevitability of punishment. It is obvious that a harsh sentence does not discourage a criminal to commit a crime if they expect to avoid any responsibility reply coredog64 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You&#x27;re missing a function: Removal. Locking up criminals prevents them committing additional crimes that impact the general public. Data from the last few years shows that there&#x27;s definitely a Pareto aspect to criminal populations, and absent an ability to rehabilitate, removal is the next best option for society at large. reply jmpetroske 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Would love to read into this research if you have a link or something to search reply lo_zamoyski 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I would argue that removal can be analyzed into the other categories, or into something that isn&#x27;t the province of punishment. 1. the deprivation of freedom is retributive 2. the prevention of additional crimes can be said to be deterrence of an active sort 3. the protection of society isn&#x27;t part of punishment per se, but a separate end This becomes clear when we consider imprisonment in relation to various crimes. Violent criminals are imprisoned in part because they are a threat to the physical safety of others. However, is an embezzler or a mayor embroiled in shady accounting a threat to anyone&#x27;s physical safety? Probably not. So the purpose of their removal is less about crime prevention and more about retribution. reply BlarfMcFlarf 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The idea is that if they are making a rational choice to embezzle or not (and have other viable options for living), then knowing jail time is a possible outcome changes the expected payout equation. In that way it can be preventative, but only in those specific sorts of cases. reply nlitened 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think there&#x27;s also a fourth &quot;end&quot; to prison punishment, but I don&#x27;t know the proper name for it. It&#x27;s when you remove the dangerous person from a society for a while, so they can&#x27;t commit crimes for that while. This is very important part of prison punishment with people with criminal tendencies, and this is why recidivists get longer prison sentences for each subsequent repetition of a similar crime. Unfortunately we have to admit that some (small) percentage of criminals cannot be rehabilitated, so they must be isolated from society. reply ChadNauseam 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The technical term is incapacitation. (Other commenters in this thread are also referring to it as “removal”.) For criminals that act alone, variations in the severity of the sentence doesn’t seem to have the impact you might expect it to have on how much it actually deters people. (And there is the issue that people in prison can share strategies between themselves for how to more effectively commit crime, which is not an ideal outcome.) So indeed, incapacitation is a very important factor. When it’s studied, you often see numbers like “increasing the sentence by 10 years prevents 0.2 crimes due to deterrence and 0.9 crimes due to incapacitation”. I say this applies to people acting alone because, although I have no proof, I suspect that organized crime is a bit more “rational” in their response to changes in sentencing. If sentencing were set up so that engaging in a category of crime was not profitable for the criminal organization, I’m pretty sure they would realize this and stop. This logic doesn’t apply to individual people, because the average person committing a crime has no idea what the sentence is or their odds of getting caught, and they obviously don’t do it often enough that the random variation is amortized out. reply tomrod 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Rehabilitation is retribution. So many things can never have full repatriation. The best we can do is have society acknowledge, forcefully, the wrongs done via prison sentencing. But then many countries go wrong on policy - punitive imprisonment leads to worse individual and social outcomes than a rehabilitation focus. reply ty6853 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] One of the most baffling elements of the justice system is how little the victim is involved in the justice. &#x27;Society&#x27; should not lord the lion&#x27;s share of the justice decisions over the victims. Quite often the victim would prefer compensation and release over getting fuck all while the perpetrator languages in prison at the tax dollar of the victim. Much of &#x27;justice&#x27; has been usurped from the victim into a jobs campaign for the state. reply bregma 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You are baffled by the western concept of justice. In western philosophy an offender is considered to have offended against society even if their crime is of a personal nature. As such, they are tried, condemned, and punished by society according to codified rules. A victim, if there is one, is not really a part of this process. There is a fundamentally sound basis for this philosophy, including equity (different justice for different people is no justice for anyone), impartiality, and respect for human rights. There are other philosophies of justice: for example, the traditional &quot;I&#x27;m strongest I get the best stuff&quot; or &quot;you dissed me ima kill you.&quot; Some are codified similarly to western justice (&quot;killing a man is requires you pay his heirs 100 she-camels of which 40 must be pregnant, killing a woman is half that, killing a Jew one-third, and so on&quot;). Others involve negotiation between victim (or their families) and offender -- which often works out well, since the offender is often is a position of power to start with and is very likely come out on top. The simple &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; is just the beginning of a very very deep rabbit hole you can go down on the road to enlightenment. reply dfxm12 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think you&#x27;re confusing or conflating civil and criminal courts. If someone breaks a law, that&#x27;s generally a matter for the state to decide in a criminal court. If someone was damaged (i.e. if the victim feels the perpetrator owes them compensation), that&#x27;s a matter for them to bring up themselves in the civil courts. These are separate functions; one situation could be tried in both courts. A famous example off the top of my head is that even though OJ Simpson wasn&#x27;t criminally convicted of murder of Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman, a civil court found him liable, awarding tens of millions of dollars in damages, to be paid to their families. reply Scoundreller 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; A famous example off the top of my head is that even though OJ Simpson wasn&#x27;t criminally convicted of murder of Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman, a civil court found him liable, awarding tens of millions of dollars in damages, to be paid to their families.

Crimes violate the social order, not just the victim. It behooves us all to have a system wherein (in theory) the system, not the victim, applies a set of rules to determine punishment, as contrary as that might seem to one’s sense of self, morals, etc. It’s a part of why “justice is blind.” reply freedomben 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Also victims are nearly always emotionally involved, and emotional-based decisions aren&#x27;t generally good. Punishments would be much more severe if it were up to the victims.

The inability to find a job coupled with the crushing interest is what leads to desperation, and then repeat criminal behavior. &gt; There is a real risk of exploitation Centralized systems always have a risk of corruption when power is concentrated in few people. Those job roles also many times attract the corrupt; and even when you have people who go in with a good moral caliber, the regular dynamics of the interactions may also twist them into being corrupt. Its a rare person with sufficient moral caliber that can survive such a job (as a guard or other prison staff) unscathed and still be a good person afterwards. Many avenues of education also do not prepare them appropriately for work in the private sector, and some careers are simply prohibited.

The sentence was for intent to distribute. It&#x27;s an extremely potent substance. This would be like discovering someone had 30,000 pills. You can&#x27;t really argue that it was for personal use at that point. They also found him in possession of carfentanil (a more potent version of fentanyl), scales, baggies, and other products. This looks like a very clear case of someone importing high-potency synthetic opioids to redistribute. High potency synthetic opioids are a high priority target for law enforcement. These are most often cut (diluted) and then sold to buyers expecting some other opioid product. As you might expect, perfectly diluting a 1mg dose of a powder into a 500mg - 1000mg pill form is extremely hard to do and there&#x27;s a high risk of &quot;hot spots&quot; forming in certain pills (or sections of a powdered product). This results in a lot of serious overdoses. It&#x27;s a severe problem right now. Most fentanyl overdoses are from users who thought they were taking some other drug.

Most fentanyl overdoses are from people who thought they were consuming a different, more familiar opioid. Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids like this one are preferred by drug dealers because it&#x27;s much easier to smuggle a tiny amount of powder and cut it 1000X than to smuggle the real product.

Prisoners in some states are regularly put into solitary confinement for not &quot;volunteering&quot; to work these jobs (a punishment that some areas deem torture). With that amount of coercion I can&#x27;t see them as voluntary, and so the slavery label is awfully close to the mark. reply freedomben 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] In those situations, I would agree that is pretty damn close to the slavery mark.

Is there a good reason why a developer in Thailand or India should be paid less than their colleague who works on the same team, but is based in the US? Many companies believe so - there&#x27;s a significant difference in the cost of living between those two employees, and employers believe it is fair to adjust the salary to provide a similar quality of life to both. Equally, a person incarcerated in New York City doesn&#x27;t have the same living costs as a person who has to live in New York City, so you could reasonably argue that any &quot;Cost of living premium&quot; that a company offers to NYC based employees doesn&#x27;t need to apply to a person who doesn&#x27;t experience those higher costs. reply tmoertel 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Is there a good reason why a developer in Thailand or India should be paid less than their colleague who works on the same team, but is based in the US? Yes, and that reason is that people in most of the developed world are free to say yes or no to job offers based on their individual preferences. And, it just so happens, in Thailand and India there are many people who will happily say yes to offers that people in the US would say no to. The cost of living explanation that companies give is illusory; the reality is that they have to pay enough to get people to say yes. Now, you might ask why people in different countries say yes to offers at different compensation levels. But I think the answer is self evident: people will say yes to offers when they believe that there are lots of other people who will say yes to it. Under those circumstances, saying no won&#x27;t earn a higher offer but cause the company to give the job to someone else. Ultimately, then, regional prices are set by what the locals are generally willing to say yes to. reply ChrisMarshallNY 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] My understanding is that top talent gets top pay, regardless of their living arrangements.

You cannot leave and so don&#x27;t have a choice about where you work. Even if cost of living is low in prison, you often still have to pay for being there and wages are far less than the cost.

What a complete bs. If anything, in India it costs MORE to achieve a similar standard of living than in the USA. In India you can spend 3 times what a US worker gets paid - and you&#x27;ll barely have enough money to get the same level of security that that worker gets. Companies don&#x27;t care, they pay the minimum amount that they think will interest the worker for long-term employment. And since in India or Thailand the workers don&#x27;t have such a wide choice in work - they will be paid less, just enough to get them. And they pay the Americans just enough to get them, it is just happening that for Americans this amount are several times bigger. That&#x27;s all here is. reply koakuma-chan 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; and employers believe it is fair to adjust the salary to provide a similar quality of life to both That&#x27;s bullshit.

The vast majority of my salary goes to fixed expenses like housing, food, healthcare, energy, and transport. Those are all highly location-dependent.

But otherwise, in terms of why he’d default to being paid less… yes, what the other commenter said: supply and demand, aka leverage.

We also don&#x27;t pay him healthcare, because he wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it. reply Ray20 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Because the level of payment almost always depends on the level of competition for a particular person&#x27;s work. When you&#x27;re in prison, there&#x27;s practically no competition for your work. So it&#x27;s expected that he&#x27;ll be paid much less. reply koakuma-chan 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I assume he doesn&#x27;t have to pay rent while in prison and gets free meals, so unless they take some of his income, he might actually be doing pretty good. reply code_for_monkey 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I guess if you look at pay as solely a result of &#x27;work done&#x27; you&#x27;d come to this conclusion, and it should work this way, but really its got more to do with the relationship between employer and employee.

Or London, if one wants to argue something about English language ability or whatever, is 80,000 USD. Literally half that of SF. Salaries aren&#x27;t determined by labor value, they&#x27;re determined by how well employers can collude in a region to get the lowest possible rate while still being able to hire people. Thus they somewhat tend to correlate with cost of living, but not really, e.g. see London vs SF vs NYC. All correlations are used as excuses, when the core, real, reason always comes down to, employers will pay as little as they can get away with. This annoyed me enough that I started a co-op about it, and we&#x27;re doing pretty well. I&#x27;m still annoyed though. Apparently glommer, the CEO, pays him &quot;full salary&quot; (market rate?), which makes them a good person, but a bad capitalist.

For folks whose upbringing maybe doesn&#x27;t afford such advantages, if services can be available where students can find reprieve from harsh daily life and be (very) modestly taken care of, I can see value.

I have years of working with defendants. I would say that a majority of DV complaints are valid in some way, and that many times the DV goes both ways (but it&#x27;s rarer for the woman to get charged, even if the instigator). The biggest issue is that once the perpetrator is removed and&#x2F;or charged the victim often petitions the prosecutor and police to drop the charges. The prosecutors I know will generally not do this and will push for a guilty plea or trial. It&#x27;s hard for the prosecutor to know whether the victim is being manipulated into asking for the charges to be dropped, and regardless, a crime has probably been committed, and in the justice system the plaintiff is the state, not the person who was battered. This can lead to a stand-off where the victim refuses to come to trial to testify, and where the prosecutor has a Hobson&#x27;s Choice of whether to arrest the victim and jail them until trial to get them on the stand or let the case drop. DV cases are hard. reply ty6853 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Some say that prosecutors in your jurisdiction are so reluctant to drop charges, that they may keep a man in jail for nearly a decade without trial, isn&#x27;t that right &#x27;years of working with defendants&#x27; jailhouse lawyer charles?

Once the defendant was able to come to court and defend themselves, only about 1&#x2F;3 of them made it to a final order. And that was by the much weaker civil rather than criminal standard.

Some notes: in Connecticut, restraining orders can be granted for a variety of reasons, not restricted to domestic violence alone. Fairly close correlation but it does include, for example, stalking. It seems unwise to assume that restraining orders alone represent the entire count of domestic violence complaints that reach the legal system. For example, surely domestic violence arrests should be counted? Which seem to be a much higher count than restraining order applications -- 24,850 DV arrests in 2011 vs. 9033 DV applications. I&#x27;m not sure how to count the 32,111 &quot;Family Violence Protective Orders&quot; in 2011; are they the result of arrests? Are they yet another possible outcome of law enforcement involvement, separate from either a requested restraining order or an arrest? There are way more reasons a restraining order might not make it to a final order besides &quot;the requestor was proven wrong.&quot; I&#x27;d want more detailed data here before reaching a conclusion. Otherwise, this assumes that failure to grant a restraining order proves lack of DV. I am not sure that it would change the percentages you&#x27;ve shown significantly -- we&#x27;re all aware of cases where restraining orders weren&#x27;t granted with very bad results, but there&#x27;s always a tendency to report on the most clickbaity outcomes. Still, worth digging into that one a bit more. Again, appreciate the cite. reply ty6853 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes I&#x27;m sure we could keep digging up more. I&#x27;ve been down this rabbit hole before so I know how it always ends: I provide a data driven take backed by source after source which ends in endless nitpicking and scrutiny and rejection of the sources, meanwhile unsourced hot takes go completely unchallenged without the demand sources, as seen in your sister comment. This is the key of this two-pronged approach, one commenter can bury the data driven comment in source rejection (without being beheld to prove a counter point, since the asserter has the burden of proof) while the sister comment can drive the more approved comment unchallenged. Of course we really know, in many cases, the two separate commenters are advancing the same line of opinion, but using this split strategy both are compartmentalized in their burdens. Although, the truth is, the scrutinizer is rarely offering counter sources of their own, which they of course are under no obligation to provide. But barring that, we&#x27;re left at worst with &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; which is a terrible standard under which to assume the word of the wife is predictive of guilt, thus even if all the sources are rejected you leave from a practical perspective no off no better than you started in predictive guilt. reply fwip 49 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Note that it&#x27;s not trivial to demonstrate that a restraining order is necessary, even in cases where domestic violence has occurred and has a reasonable risk of recurring.

I quickly searched and found this article: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;yiiBF The original link does not say that the girlfriend reported the broken arm to the police. The police were called by her mother, who made the allegation against Thorpe. The article above says: &gt; According to [Thorpe&#x27;s lawyer]’s appeal, Abogast told police she had fallen three days before Thorpe’s arrest and doctors at Elliot Hospital said her arm was broken in three places. The original link says that she had scars and scabbing on her face, but this link says that Thorpe also had scars and scabbing, which the police noted in their report as consistent with drug abuse. I&#x27;m not one to disbelieve women when they report abuse. In this case, the alleged victim didn&#x27;t report any abuse, a third party who was not witness to any alleged crimes did. It&#x27;s also very unusual to have your arm broken in three places, call your mom to say what happened, and then not seek any kind of treatment. I feel sad for everyone involved, because it&#x27;s clear to me at least that the drug issues were the crux of the matter (which is corroborated by the actions and findings of the state). Without a statement from the girlfriend or a finding by the state, any suggestion of domestic abuse is unwarranted speculation. reply awongh 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I feel ok that there&#x27;s a distinction between legal rulings and other circumstances of the case that I as an internet person can use my judgement to understand.

There&#x27;s both a strong correlation and a proven causation that drugs and domestic abuse go hand in hand across the prison population. However, on any individual case the same is not true, because that moves from talking about averages and general cases into specifics, and the burden of proof changes significantly.

That would still be required in a civil trial with preponderance of evidence. What if she was on drugs and did it to herself? (Not saying that&#x27;s what happened).

The court system is a collection of complicated and convoluted standards and rules and regulations designed specifically to support a system responsible for depriving people of their rights. A court judgement is not &quot;better&quot; than a human judgement, quite the opposite, a court judgement is often worse, because court judgements are formed without access to all information.

Making a derogatory comment about someone on the internet is much more analogous to a civil court finding against the plaintiff than it is to a criminal court giving someone a jail sentence. In any case, HN is very selective about this high evidential standard.

I don&#x27;t understand it. It definitely sounds horrible in any case. However, the point of a program of hiring or educating people who are in prison isn&#x27;t to judge them. They are already in prison. 10years is a long time, so it&#x27;s likely they did something bad and have been judged for it. This is to give people who are capable and willing a chance to grow and integrate. From the little knowledge I have about this, it seems like this is very effective. reply semiquaver 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It’s a judicial opinion denying his appeal.

They made that decision and faced the consequences. Shifting the blame for their poor decisions onto the drug dealer is unwarranted imo. reply oersted 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I agree it’s not black and white, but let’s be reasonable. When you sell to an addict the drug they crave, knowing full well that they will take it, and you switch it with deadly poison, just because it’s cheaper? I mean, it is hard to argue that it is not an act of both fraud and premeditated murder, at the very least gross negligence. Is the addict responsible for the risk they were obviously taking? Well sure, not that they have much of a choice at that point, but there’s always a choice, and mostly they got themselves into that situation, and they are committing a crime too. Still that doesn’t take much blame away from the dealer. It’s like saying: it’s your fault that you got shot for being in the wrong neighborhood at night. Were they knowingly taking a risk? Sure, but the murderer is still a murderer. And we long got rid of the concept of “outlaw” where if you commit a crime any subsequent crime on you is fair game. That’s rather barbaric. EDIT: I was assuming that it is obvious that no one takes such synthetic opioids on purpose. They are known not to be much fun and very dangerous. They are mostly used as a cheap filler in other more mainstream drugs, most notably in fake branded prescription drugs. reply djrj477dhsnv 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Agreed if the dealer is lying and selling something more dangerous than he is claiming to sell. reply pookha 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The Russians tried using a carfentanil aerosol to sedate hostages and it killed over 120 people.

If not, what is the reason you decide the two situations differently? reply djrj477dhsnv 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don&#x27;t think the analogy holds. A drug user wants to buy from the dealer. The dealer is providing a service that the drug user can voluntarily turn down. I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s similar to a driver running into a jaywalker. Just because he&#x27;s jaywalking doesn&#x27;t mean he wants a driver to hit him. reply tptacek 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] In the law, the jaywalker and the driver will share responsibility. If you knowingly sell carfentanil, the mechanism by which the law apportions blame onto the &quot;victim&quot; won&#x27;t exist: there is no set plausible of circumstances in which you could reasonably believe it was OK to sell someone carfentanil, where in the jaywalking case there are dueling factors of pedestrial negligence and driver duty of care. reply calmoo 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Not to defend the author, but I think a more generous reading of this section from the blogpost: &gt; A brief summary is that I&#x27;m currently serving prison time for poor decisions and lifestyle choices I made in my twenties, all related to drugs.

Everything I said was generic differences between actually doing something and not having charges brought vs given the presumption of innocence while defense against charges. reply calmoo 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Still accurate though reply ThinkBeat 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The most common reason violent offenders escape charges or conviction or domestic abuse is that the victim(s) are too afraid to press charges, and&#x2F;or they feel guilty about it happening or even the feeling that they brought it on themselves and deserved it. This then combined with the fact that the abuser is going to jail for on unrelated convictions. This is a huge relief to any abuse survivor. The person is going away, and I will be safe. The other component is all the steps involved with filing charges which will often feel invasive and have to bring it all up again. I have seen this up close and personal on a few occasions, I have begged the victim to go to the police but they would not do it. The worst outcome of this is when the abuser is let out, the abuser may seek out the victim again, or the abuser will find new victims. In this case the police had a call from a close family member accusing the person of domestic abuse. They had suspicious behavior from the accused person. They also witnessed that the possible victim had multiple injuries consistent with domestic abuse. As well as the arm injury the call from the family member had initially reported. But probably no charges or at least no convictions. reply myrmidon 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Where is OP not being truthful?

When we add metrics, logging, or distributed tracing to our applications, it helps us understand what’s going on with performance and key UX metrics like success rate and latency. But what’s the cost? I’m not talking about the price of observability tools here, I mean the instrumentation overhead. If an application logs or traces everything it does, that’s bound to slow it down or at least increase resource consumption. Of course, that doesn’t mean we should give up on observability. But it does mean we should measure the overhead so we can make informed tradeoffs. These days, when people talk about instrumenting applications, in 99% of cases they mean OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry is a vendor-neutral open source framework for collecting telemetry data from your app such as metrics, logs, and traces. It’s quickly become the industry standard. In this post, I want to measure the overhead of using OpenTelemetry in a Go application. To do that, I’ll use a super simple Go HTTP server that increments a counter in an in-memory database Valkey (a Redis fork) on every request. The idea behind the benchmark is straightforward: First, we’ll run the app under load without any instrumentation and measure its performance and resource usage. Then, using the exact same workload, we’ll repeat the test with OpenTelemetry SDK for Go enabled and compare the results. Test setup For this benchmark, I’ll use four Linux nodes, each with 4 vCPUs and 8GB of RAM. One will run the application, another will host Valkey, a third will be used for the load generator, and the fourth for observability (using Coroot Community Edition). I want to make sure the components involved in the test don’t interfere with each other, so I’m running them on separate nodes. This time, I’m not using Kubernetes, instead, I’ll run everything in plain Docker containers. I’m also using the host network mode for all containers, to avoid docker-proxy introducing any additional latency into the network path. Now, let’s take a look at the application code: package main import ( &quot;context&quot; &quot;log&quot; &quot;net/http&quot; &quot;os&quot; &quot;strconv&quot; &quot;github.com/go-redis/redis/extra/redisotel&quot; &quot;github.com/go-redis/redis/v8&quot; &quot;go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp&quot; &quot;go.opentelemetry.io/otel&quot; &quot;go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace&quot; &quot;go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracehttp&quot; &quot;go.opentelemetry.io/otel/propagation&quot; &quot;go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace&quot; ) var ( rdb *redis.Client ) func initTracing() { rdb.AddHook(redisotel.TracingHook{}) client := otlptracehttp.NewClient() exporter, err := otlptrace.New(context.Background(), client) if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } tracerProvider := trace.NewTracerProvider(trace.WithBatcher(exporter)) otel.SetTracerProvider(tracerProvider) otel.SetTextMapPropagator(propagation.NewCompositeTextMapPropagator( propagation.TraceContext{}, propagation.Baggage{}, )) } func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { cmd := rdb.Incr(r.Context(), &quot;counter&quot;) if err := cmd.Err(); err != nil { http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError) return } _, _ = w.Write([]byte(strconv.FormatInt(cmd.Val(), 10))) } func main() { rdb = redis.NewClient(&amp;redis.Options{Addr: os.Getenv(&quot;REDIS_SERVER&quot;)}) h := http.Handler(http.HandlerFunc(handler)) if os.Getenv(&quot;ENABLE_OTEL&quot;) != &quot;&quot; { log.Println(&quot;enabling opentelemetry&quot;) initTracing() h = otelhttp.NewHandler(http.HandlerFunc(handler), &quot;GET /&quot;) } log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8080&quot;, h)) } By default, the application runs without instrumentation. Only if the environment variable ENABLE_OTEL is set, the OpenTelemetry SDK will be initialized. So runs without this variable will serve as the baseline for comparison. Running the Benchmark Now let’s start all the components and begin testing. First, we launch Valkey using the following command: docker run --name valkey -d --net=host valkey/valkey Next, we start the Go app and point it to the Valkey instance by IP: docker run -d --name app -e REDIS_SERVER=&quot;192.168.1.2:6379&quot; --net=host failurepedia/redis-app:0.5 To generate load, I’ll use wrk2 , which allows precise control over request rate. In this test, I’m setting it to 10,000 requests per second using 100 connections and 8 threads. Each run will last 20 minutes: docker run --rm --name load-generator -ti cylab/wrk2 \ -t8 -c100 -d1200s -R10000 --u_latency http://192.168.1.3:8080/ Results Let’s take a look at the results. We started by running the app without any instrumentation. This serves as our baseline for performance and resource usage. Based on metrics gathered by Coroot using eBPF, the app successfully handled 10,000 requests per second. The majority of requests were served in under 5 milliseconds. The 95th percentile (p95) latency was around 5ms, the 99th percentile (p99) was about 10ms, with occasional spikes reaching up to 20ms. CPU usage was steady at around 2 CPU cores (or 2 CPU seconds per second), and memory consumption stayed low at roughly 10 MB. So that’s our baseline. Now, let’s restart the app container with the OpenTelemetry SDK enabled and see how things change: docker run -d --name app \ -e REDIS_SERVER=&quot;192.168.1.2:6379&quot; \ -e ENABLE_OTEL=1 \ -e OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=&quot;app&quot; \ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=&quot;http://192.168.1.4:8080/v1/traces&quot; \ --net=host failurepedia/redis-app:0.5 Everything else stayed the same &#8211; the infrastructure, the workload, and the duration of the test. Now let’s break down what changed. Memory usage increased from around 10 megabytes to somewhere between 15 and 18 megabytes. This additional overhead comes from the SDK and its background processes for handling telemetry data. While there is a clear difference, it doesn’t look like a significant increase in absolute terms, especially for modern applications where memory budgets are typically much larger. CPU usage jumped from 2 cores to roughly 2.7 cores. That’s about a 35 percent increase. This is expected since the app is now tracing every request, preparing and exporting spans, and doing more work in the background. To understand exactly where this additional CPU usage was coming from, I used Coroot’s built-in eBPF-based CPU profiler to capture and compare profiles before and after enabling OpenTelemetry. The profiler showed that about 10 percent of total CPU time was spent in go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace.NewBatchSpanProcessor , which handles span batching and export. Redis calls also got slightly more expensive — tracing added around 7 percent CPU overhead to go-redis operations. The rest of the increase came from instrumented HTTP handlers and middleware. In short, the overhead comes from OpenTelemetry’s span processing pipeline, not from the app’s core logic. Latency also changed, though not dramatically. With OpenTelemetry enabled, more requests fell into the 5 to 10 millisecond range. The 99th percentile latency went from 10 to about 15 milliseconds. Throughput remained stable at around 10,000 requests per second. We didn’t see any errors or timeouts. Network traffic also increased. With tracing enabled, the app started exporting telemetry data to Coroot, which resulted in an outbound traffic volume of about 4 megabytes per second, or roughly 32 megabits per second. For high-throughput services or environments with strict network constraints, this is something to keep in mind when enabling full request-level tracing. Overall, enabling OpenTelemetry introduced a noticeable but controlled overhead. These numbers aren’t negligible, especially at scale — but they’re also not a dealbreaker. For most teams, the visibility gained through distributed tracing and the ability to troubleshoot issues faster will justify the tradeoff. eBPF-based instrumentation I often hear from engineers, especially in ad tech and other high-throughput environments, that they simply can’t afford the overhead of distributed tracing. At the same time, observability is absolutely critical for them. This is exactly the kind of scenario where eBPF-based instrumentation fits well. Instead of modifying application code or adding SDKs, an agent can observe application behavior at the kernel level using eBPF. Coroot’s agent supports this approach and is capable of collecting both metrics and traces using eBPF, without requiring any changes to the application itself. However, in high-load environments like the one used in this benchmark, we generally recommend disabling eBPF-based tracing and working with metrics only. Metrics still allow us to clearly see how services interact with each other, without storing data about every single request. They’re also much more efficient in terms of storage and runtime overhead. Throughout both runs of our test, Coroot’s agent was running on each node. Here’s what its CPU usage looked like: Node201 was running Valkey, node203 was running the app, and node204 was the load generator. As the chart shows, even under consistent load, the agent’s CPU usage stayed under 0.3 cores. That makes it lightweight enough for production use, especially when working in metrics-only mode. This approach offers a practical balance: good visibility with minimal cost. Final Thoughts Observability comes at a cost, but as this experiment shows, that cost depends heavily on how you choose to implement it. OpenTelemetry SDKs provide detailed traces and deep visibility, but they also introduce measurable overhead in terms of CPU, memory, and network traffic. For many teams, especially when fast incident resolution is a priority, that tradeoff is entirely justified. At the same time, eBPF-based instrumentation offers a more lightweight option. It allows you to collect meaningful metrics without modifying application code and keeps resource usage minimal, especially when tracing is disabled and only metrics are collected. The right choice depends on your goals. If you need full traceability and detailed diagnostics, SDK-based tracing is a strong option. If your priority is low overhead and broad system visibility, eBPF-based metrics might be the better fit. Observability isn’t free, but with the right approach, it can be both effective and efficient. Working with GPUs on Kubernetes and making them observable Try Coroot Now!

The amazing thing about it is that it gives real jobs to prisoners that they can seamlessly continue after they get out of prison. Normally when you get out, it&#x27;s impossible to get a job, and the clock is ticking. This leads to desperation, which leads to bad behavior. There is a real risk of exploitation, but if it&#x27;s properly managed, remote work for prisoners is one of the most hopeful things I&#x27;ve heard about the prison system. It gives people purpose while there and an avenue to success once they&#x27;re out. reply larodi 0 minutes ago | parent | next [–] Wonder if they acquire the skills to break into systems, why would they choose not to do it in this crazy world out there?

This is #3 comment I see when I open HN, ensuing thread takes up two pages scrolls on 16&quot; MBP. It&#x27;s bad of me to write this because, well, who cares? Additionally, am I trying to litigate what other people comment? The root feeling driving me to express myself is a form of frustrated boredom -- rolling with that and verbalizing concretely, a bunch of people writing comments with the one thing they&#x27;re hyperfocusing on their record to drive a conclusion on their value as a person&#x2F;morality, and then people pointing out that&#x27;s not some moral absolute, asking for links, discussing the links... ...well, it&#x27;s all just clutter. Or YouTube comment-level discussion, unless we&#x27;re planning on relitigating every case he&#x27;s been involved in. This all would be better if it the kangaroo court stuff was confined to a thread with all of the evidence against him, so we didn&#x27;t have a bunch of weak cases, or if people didn&#x27;t treat this as an opportunity to be a drive by judge. Article def. ain&#x27;t about his crimes, and he ain&#x27;t saying he&#x27;s innocent or an angel. (and the idea that &quot;drug crimes&quot; implies &quot;hippie selling weed or psychedelics&quot; so calling them &quot;drug crimes&quot; is hiding the ball...where does that come from? Its especially dissonant b&#x2F;c you indicate the mere fact he sold an opiod is so bad that this guy is...bad? irredeemable? not worth discussing?...so presumably you care a lot about opiods, so presumably you know that&#x27;s whats driven drug crime the last, uh, decade or two?) reply badc0ffee 13 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; trying to make a definitive case on his...goodness? morality? Speaking for myself, I&#x27;m actually just discussing the idea that a non-violent crime like drug dealing necessarily deserves a light sentence in general. &gt; Sounds like a you thing It is a me thing. That&#x27;s why I said &quot;brings to mind&quot;. I&#x27;m a product of my time. I remember when weed and psychedelics meant demonization and heavy sentences, and it was absurd because those substances aren&#x27;t that dangerous. This is the context in which I&#x27;m accustomed to calling drug dealing a &quot;non-violent crime&quot;. So, I feel like I need to point out that things are not quite the same with deadly drugs like carfentanil. reply CobrastanJorji 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Oh absolutely.

Lowering the cost of keeping people in prison would make it even easier for the government to lock people up for smaller crimes and with bigger sentences. It&#x27;s even worse with the privatised prison system that the US has. They already know the &quot;market price&quot; (what the government is willing to spend) so adding &quot;free money&quot; into the equation just makes it easier for them to raise prices and end up pocketing even more money than they already do. Framing it as offsetting the cost would also make it very easy to increase the cut, bit by bit, until it gets to a truly unreasonable level. And since the person is already in prison and we have to pay for them no matter what, why would they choose to work if the deal is so bad? reply dfxm12 52 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] It&#x27;s even worse with the privatised prison system that the US has.

It is important that we recognize all of the purposes of punishment instead of overemphasizing one or neglecting the other. Punishment has three ends: retribution, rehabilitation, and deterrence. It is important that you pay for your crime for the sake of justice; it is charitable and prudent to rehabilitate the criminal, satisfying the corrective end of punishment; and would-be criminals must be given tangible evidence of what awaits them if they choose to indulge an evil temptation, thus acting as a deterrent. In our systems today, we either neglect correction, leaving people to rot in prison or endanger them with recidivism by throwing them back onto the streets with no correction, or we take an attitude of false compassion toward the perp by failing to inflict adequate justice, incidentally failing the deterrent end in the process. reply HappMacDonald 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Punishment has three ends: retribution, rehabilitation, and deterrence. One might argue a fourth end as well: removal. When people talk about &quot;cleaning up the streets&quot; they don&#x27;t mean causing ruffians to clean up their act, what they refer to is removing the ruffians entirely. To &quot;someplace else&quot;. To &quot;Not in my backyard&quot;. Out of sight, out of mind as is often said. For profit prisons may view prisoners as cheap labor or levy bait, but for the voting public who gets no cut of that action the real inducement starts and ends with &quot;make the problem go away&quot;. Sweep human beings we do not know how to cohabitate with under a rug. Retribution may appeal to those directly wronged, or to the minority of sadists in a population. Deterrence is oft admired, but few honestly believe it&#x27;s really possible given that harsh sentences never seem to cause crime to go to zero (sensationalism-driven media that magnifies every mole-hill notwithstanding) and that repeat offenses outnumber first offenses. Rehabilitation appeals to those with compassion, though nobody has a clear bead on how to actually land that plane with more than the lowest hanging fruit of only-slightly-off-course offenders.

Locking up criminals prevents them committing additional crimes that impact the general public. Data from the last few years shows that there&#x27;s definitely a Pareto aspect to criminal populations, and absent an ability to rehabilitate, removal is the next best option for society at large. reply jmpetroske 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Would love to read into this research if you have a link or something to search reply lo_zamoyski 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I would argue that removal can be analyzed into the other categories, or into something that isn&#x27;t the province of punishment. 1. the deprivation of freedom is retributive 2. the prevention of additional crimes can be said to be deterrence of an active sort 3. the protection of society isn&#x27;t part of punishment per se, but a separate end This becomes clear when we consider imprisonment in relation to various crimes. Violent criminals are imprisoned in part because they are a threat to the physical safety of others. However, is an embezzler or a mayor embroiled in shady accounting a threat to anyone&#x27;s physical safety? Probably not. So the purpose of their removal is less about crime prevention and more about retribution. reply BlarfMcFlarf 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The idea is that if they are making a rational choice to embezzle or not (and have other viable options for living), then knowing jail time is a possible outcome changes the expected payout equation. In that way it can be preventative, but only in those specific sorts of cases. reply nlitened 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think there&#x27;s also a fourth &quot;end&quot; to prison punishment, but I don&#x27;t know the proper name for it. It&#x27;s when you remove the dangerous person from a society for a while, so they can&#x27;t commit crimes for that while. This is very important part of prison punishment with people with criminal tendencies, and this is why recidivists get longer prison sentences for each subsequent repetition of a similar crime. Unfortunately we have to admit that some (small) percentage of criminals cannot be rehabilitated, so they must be isolated from society. reply ChadNauseam 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The technical term is incapacitation. (Other commenters in this thread are also referring to it as “removal”.) For criminals that act alone, variations in the severity of the sentence doesn’t seem to have the impact you might expect it to have on how much it actually deters people. (And there is the issue that people in prison can share strategies between themselves for how to more effectively commit crime, which is not an ideal outcome.) So indeed, incapacitation is a very important factor. When it’s studied, you often see numbers like “increasing the sentence by 10 years prevents 0.2 crimes due to deterrence and 0.9 crimes due to incapacitation”. I say this applies to people acting alone because, although I have no proof, I suspect that organized crime is a bit more “rational” in their response to changes in sentencing. If sentencing were set up so that engaging in a category of crime was not profitable for the criminal organization, I’m pretty sure they would realize this and stop. This logic doesn’t apply to individual people, because the average person committing a crime has no idea what the sentence is or their odds of getting caught, and they obviously don’t do it often enough that the random variation is amortized out. reply tomrod 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Rehabilitation is retribution. So many things can never have full repatriation. The best we can do is have society acknowledge, forcefully, the wrongs done via prison sentencing.

Quite often the victim would prefer compensation and release over getting fuck all while the perpetrator languages in prison at the tax dollar of the victim. Much of &#x27;justice&#x27; has been usurped from the victim into a jobs campaign for the state. reply bregma 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You are baffled by the western concept of justice. In western philosophy an offender is considered to have offended against society even if their crime is of a personal nature. As such, they are tried, condemned, and punished by society according to codified rules. A victim, if there is one, is not really a part of this process. There is a fundamentally sound basis for this philosophy, including equity (different justice for different people is no justice for anyone), impartiality, and respect for human rights. There are other philosophies of justice: for example, the traditional &quot;I&#x27;m strongest I get the best stuff&quot; or &quot;you dissed me ima kill you.&quot; Some are codified similarly to western justice (&quot;killing a man is requires you pay his heirs 100 she-camels of which 40 must be pregnant, killing a woman is half that, killing a Jew one-third, and so on&quot;). Others involve negotiation between victim (or their families) and offender -- which often works out well, since the offender is often is a position of power to start with and is very likely come out on top. The simple &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; is just the beginning of a very very deep rabbit hole you can go down on the road to enlightenment. reply dfxm12 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think you&#x27;re confusing or conflating civil and criminal courts.

These are separate functions; one situation could be tried in both courts.

Crimes violate the social order, not just the victim.

Punishments would be much more severe if it were up to the victims.

Its a rare person with sufficient moral caliber that can survive such a job (as a guard or other prison staff) unscathed and still be a good person afterwards.

The sentence was for intent to distribute. It&#x27;s an extremely potent substance. This would be like discovering someone had 30,000 pills. You can&#x27;t really argue that it was for personal use at that point. They also found him in possession of carfentanil (a more potent version of fentanyl), scales, baggies, and other products. This looks like a very clear case of someone importing high-potency synthetic opioids to redistribute. High potency synthetic opioids are a high priority target for law enforcement. These are most often cut (diluted) and then sold to buyers expecting some other opioid product. As you might expect, perfectly diluting a 1mg dose of a powder into a 500mg - 1000mg pill form is extremely hard to do and there&#x27;s a high risk of &quot;hot spots&quot; forming in certain pills (or sections of a powdered product). This results in a lot of serious overdoses. It&#x27;s a severe problem right now. Most fentanyl overdoses are from users who thought they were taking some other drug.

I know folks that served time for murder, that have very good careers, and people that have misdemeanor records, that have always struggled. reply justin66 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Different states have rules about expungement, as far as what happens automatically, what can be done if an offender convinces a judge, and how much it all costs. Federal crimes (and I don&#x27;t think that applies in this person&#x27;s case since they&#x27;re in a Maine DOC prison, although drug crimes of this kind easily could be charged by the feds) aren&#x27;t usually expunged. Even if you receive a pardon, the original crime (and a note of the pardon) will exist on the record. It&#x27;s a really strange system. You&#x27;re meant to lie and say &quot;no&quot; during interviews after your conviction is expunged if you are asked &quot;have you ever been convicted of a crime,&quot; although I believe in many states it&#x27;s now illegal to ask such a question. reply wil421 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] My state will automatically expunge non violent misdemeanors after 2010, so if it happened before you have to jump through hoops.

The eighth and fourteenth amendments almost certainly forbid enslavement - permanently becoming human property - as a criminal sentence. Even before the 13th amendment, enslavement as a punishment not common, if it happened at all. There is almost no case law on the 13th amendment.

Is there a good reason why a developer in Thailand or India should be paid less than their colleague who works on the same team, but is based in the US? Many companies believe so - there&#x27;s a significant difference in the cost of living between those two employees, and employers believe it is fair to adjust the salary to provide a similar quality of life to both. Equally, a person incarcerated in New York City doesn&#x27;t have the same living costs as a person who has to live in New York City, so you could reasonably argue that any &quot;Cost of living premium&quot; that a company offers to NYC based employees doesn&#x27;t need to apply to a person who doesn&#x27;t experience those higher costs. reply tmoertel 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Is there a good reason why a developer in Thailand or India should be paid less than their colleague who works on the same team, but is based in the US? Yes, and that reason is that people in most of the developed world are free to say yes or no to job offers based on their individual preferences. And, it just so happens, in Thailand and India there are many people who will happily say yes to offers that people in the US would say no to. The cost of living explanation that companies give is illusory; the reality is that they have to pay enough to get people to say yes. Now, you might ask why people in different countries say yes to offers at different compensation levels. But I think the answer is self evident: people will say yes to offers when they believe that there are lots of other people who will say yes to it. Under those circumstances, saying no won&#x27;t earn a higher offer but cause the company to give the job to someone else. Ultimately, then, regional prices are set by what the locals are generally willing to say yes to. reply ChrisMarshallNY 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] My understanding is that top talent gets top pay, regardless of their living arrangements.

You cannot leave and so don&#x27;t have a choice about where you work. Even if cost of living is low in prison, you often still have to pay for being there and wages are far less than the cost.

What a complete bs. If anything, in India it costs MORE to achieve a similar standard of living than in the USA. In India you can spend 3 times what a US worker gets paid - and you&#x27;ll barely have enough money to get the same level of security that that worker gets. Companies don&#x27;t care, they pay the minimum amount that they think will interest the worker for long-term employment. And since in India or Thailand the workers don&#x27;t have such a wide choice in work - they will be paid less, just enough to get them. And they pay the Americans just enough to get them, it is just happening that for Americans this amount are several times bigger.

The vast majority of my salary goes to fixed expenses like housing, food, healthcare, energy, and transport. Those are all highly location-dependent.

But otherwise, in terms of why he’d default to being paid less… yes, what the other commenter said: supply and demand, aka leverage.

Or London, if one wants to argue something about English language ability or whatever, is 80,000 USD. Literally half that of SF. Salaries aren&#x27;t determined by labor value, they&#x27;re determined by how well employers can collude in a region to get the lowest possible rate while still being able to hire people. Thus they somewhat tend to correlate with cost of living, but not really, e.g. see London vs SF vs NYC.

Almost zero jails or prisons have any access to the Internet at all. Many of the places I know won&#x27;t even allow a print-out of any information from the Internet (e.g. Wikipedia, Facebook etc) and won&#x27;t allow any books about computers for security reasons. Commissary is generally &quot;gas station&quot; prices in jails and prisons. Some of the inmates I work with right now have tablets that allow music streaming from a small catalog, but I think it is $3&#x2F;hour to listen to it. Obviously the families and friends of the loved are the ones burdened with paying for all of these, unless you can get an in-prison job that pays, e.g. dealing drugs is probably the highest paid, sadly. reply msarchet 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] There’s a link to a post on his personal blog that explains a lot of this reply josh_carterPDX 4 hours ago | prev | next [–] This needs to be a model for other states to follow.

I have years of working with defendants. I would say that a majority of DV complaints are valid in some way, and that many times the DV goes both ways (but it&#x27;s rarer for the woman to get charged, even if the instigator). The biggest issue is that once the perpetrator is removed and&#x2F;or charged the victim often petitions the prosecutor and police to drop the charges. The prosecutors I know will generally not do this and will push for a guilty plea or trial. It&#x27;s hard for the prosecutor to know whether the victim is being manipulated into asking for the charges to be dropped, and regardless, a crime has probably been committed, and in the justice system the plaintiff is the state, not the person who was battered. This can lead to a stand-off where the victim refuses to come to trial to testify, and where the prosecutor has a Hobson&#x27;s Choice of whether to arrest the victim and jail them until trial to get them on the stand or let the case drop. DV cases are hard. reply ty6853 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Some say that prosecutors in your jurisdiction are so reluctant to drop charges, that they may keep a man in jail for nearly a decade without trial, isn&#x27;t that right &#x27;years of working with defendants&#x27; jailhouse lawyer charles?

Once the defendant was able to come to court and defend themselves, only about 1&#x2F;3 of them made it to a final order. And that was by the much weaker civil rather than criminal standard.

Some notes: in Connecticut, restraining orders can be granted for a variety of reasons, not restricted to domestic violence alone. Fairly close correlation but it does include, for example, stalking. It seems unwise to assume that restraining orders alone represent the entire count of domestic violence complaints that reach the legal system. For example, surely domestic violence arrests should be counted? Which seem to be a much higher count than restraining order applications -- 24,850 DV arrests in 2011 vs. 9033 DV applications. I&#x27;m not sure how to count the 32,111 &quot;Family Violence Protective Orders&quot; in 2011; are they the result of arrests? Are they yet another possible outcome of law enforcement involvement, separate from either a requested restraining order or an arrest? There are way more reasons a restraining order might not make it to a final order besides &quot;the requestor was proven wrong.&quot; I&#x27;d want more detailed data here before reaching a conclusion. Otherwise, this assumes that failure to grant a restraining order proves lack of DV. I am not sure that it would change the percentages you&#x27;ve shown significantly -- we&#x27;re all aware of cases where restraining orders weren&#x27;t granted with very bad results, but there&#x27;s always a tendency to report on the most clickbaity outcomes. Still, worth digging into that one a bit more. Again, appreciate the cite. reply ty6853 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes I&#x27;m sure we could keep digging up more. I&#x27;ve been down this rabbit hole before so I know how it always ends: I provide a data driven take backed by source after source which ends in endless nitpicking and scrutiny and rejection of the sources, meanwhile unsourced hot takes go completely unchallenged without the demand sources, as seen in your sister comment. This is the key of this two-pronged approach, one commenter can bury the data driven comment in source rejection (without being beheld to prove a counter point, since the asserter has the burden of proof) while the sister comment can drive the more approved comment unchallenged. Of course we really know, in many cases, the two separate commenters are advancing the same line of opinion, but using this split strategy both are compartmentalized in their burdens. Although, the truth is, the scrutinizer is rarely offering counter sources of their own, which they of course are under no obligation to provide. But barring that, we&#x27;re left at worst with &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; which is a terrible standard under which to assume the word of the wife is predictive of guilt, thus even if all the sources are rejected you leave from a practical perspective no off no better than you started in predictive guilt. reply fwip 49 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Note that it&#x27;s not trivial to demonstrate that a restraining order is necessary, even in cases where domestic violence has occurred and has a reasonable risk of recurring.

I quickly searched and found this article: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;yiiBF The original link does not say that the girlfriend reported the broken arm to the police. The police were called by her mother, who made the allegation against Thorpe. The article above says: &gt; According to [Thorpe&#x27;s lawyer]’s appeal, Abogast told police she had fallen three days before Thorpe’s arrest and doctors at Elliot Hospital said her arm was broken in three places. The original link says that she had scars and scabbing on her face, but this link says that Thorpe also had scars and scabbing, which the police noted in their report as consistent with drug abuse. I&#x27;m not one to disbelieve women when they report abuse. In this case, the alleged victim didn&#x27;t report any abuse, a third party who was not witness to any alleged crimes did. It&#x27;s also very unusual to have your arm broken in three places, call your mom to say what happened, and then not seek any kind of treatment. I feel sad for everyone involved, because it&#x27;s clear to me at least that the drug issues were the crux of the matter (which is corroborated by the actions and findings of the state). Without a statement from the girlfriend or a finding by the state, any suggestion of domestic abuse is unwarranted speculation. reply awongh 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I feel ok that there&#x27;s a distinction between legal rulings and other circumstances of the case that I as an internet person can use my judgement to understand.

However, on any individual case the same is not true, because that moves from talking about averages and general cases into specifics, and the burden of proof changes significantly.

A court judgement is not &quot;better&quot; than a human judgement, quite the opposite, a court judgement is often worse, because court judgements are formed without access to all information.

Personally, I&#x27;d give a convicted drug dealer less benefit of the doubt than the average person. reply qualeed 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; There&#x27;s no scenario here where this guy is innocent. The conservation expanded past this specific case when we started talking generally about internet comments. reply foldr 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] We&#x27;re allowed to form judgments about people based on evidence that wouldn&#x27;t be sufficient to convict them of a crime. The consequences of me forming the opinion that this guy is a domestic abuser are far lower than the consequences of a court doing so. And of course, even courts use a much lower evidential standard than &#x27;innocent until proven guilty&#x27; when deciding civil cases. Making a derogatory comment about someone on the internet is much more analogous to a civil court finding against the plaintiff than it is to a criminal court giving someone a jail sentence. In any case, HN is very selective about this high evidential standard. People will make a lot of effort to give probable domestic abusers the benefit of the doubt, but pick one of HN&#x27;s official enemies and suddenly any little scrap of evidence is considered quite sufficient! reply catigula 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I agree with this sentiment but I&#x27;m also willing to explore&#x2F;consider the possibility that &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; isn&#x27;t strictly only useful as an esoteric legal construct, but a philosophy that could potentially have applicability to an individual&#x27;s worldview. That being said I wouldn&#x27;t have much patience for a &quot;merely&quot; accused murderer or child predator in my personal life, just as I also don&#x27;t have much patience for a doctor who refuses to prescribe me antibiotics because the chance they could help me is &quot;only&quot; 1%.

I also know women that have drained their husband&#x27;s retirement, people that have snorted their kids&#x27; college funds, mothers that have pimped their kids, and other stuff that would have a lot of folks horrified.

They made that decision and faced the consequences. Shifting the blame for their poor decisions onto the drug dealer is unwarranted imo. reply oersted 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I agree it’s not black and white, but let’s be reasonable. When you sell to an addict the drug they crave, knowing full well that they will take it, and you switch it with deadly poison, just because it’s cheaper? I mean, it is hard to argue that it is not an act of both fraud and premeditated murder, at the very least gross negligence. Is the addict responsible for the risk they were obviously taking? Well sure, not that they have much of a choice at that point, but there’s always a choice, and mostly they got themselves into that situation, and they are committing a crime too. Still that doesn’t take much blame away from the dealer. It’s like saying: it’s your fault that you got shot for being in the wrong neighborhood at night. Were they knowingly taking a risk? Sure, but the murderer is still a murderer. And we long got rid of the concept of “outlaw” where if you commit a crime any subsequent crime on you is fair game. That’s rather barbaric. EDIT: I was assuming that it is obvious that no one takes such synthetic opioids on purpose. They are known not to be much fun and very dangerous. They are mostly used as a cheap filler in other more mainstream drugs, most notably in fake branded prescription drugs. reply djrj477dhsnv 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Agreed if the dealer is lying and selling something more dangerous than he is claiming to sell. reply pookha 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The Russians tried using a carfentanil aerosol to sedate hostages and it killed over 120 people.

If not, what is the reason you decide the two situations differently? reply djrj477dhsnv 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don&#x27;t think the analogy holds. A drug user wants to buy from the dealer. The dealer is providing a service that the drug user can voluntarily turn down. I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s similar to a driver running into a jaywalker. Just because he&#x27;s jaywalking doesn&#x27;t mean he wants a driver to hit him. reply tptacek 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] In the law, the jaywalker and the driver will share responsibility. If you knowingly sell carfentanil, the mechanism by which the law apportions blame onto the &quot;victim&quot; won&#x27;t exist: there is no set plausible of circumstances in which you could reasonably believe it was OK to sell someone carfentanil, where in the jaywalking case there are dueling factors of pedestrial negligence and driver duty of care. reply calmoo 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Not to defend the author, but I think a more generous reading of this section from the blogpost: &gt; A brief summary is that I&#x27;m currently serving prison time for poor decisions and lifestyle choices I made in my twenties, all related to drugs.

Everything I said was generic differences between actually doing something and not having charges brought vs given the presumption of innocence while defense against charges. reply calmoo 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Still accurate though reply ThinkBeat 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The most common reason violent offenders escape charges or conviction or domestic abuse is that the victim(s) are too afraid to press charges, and&#x2F;or they feel guilty about it happening or even the feeling that they brought it on themselves and deserved it. This then combined with the fact that the abuser is going to jail for on unrelated convictions. This is a huge relief to any abuse survivor. The person is going away, and I will be safe. The other component is all the steps involved with filing charges which will often feel invasive and have to bring it all up again. I have seen this up close and personal on a few occasions, I have begged the victim to go to the police but they would not do it. The worst outcome of this is when the abuser is let out, the abuser may seek out the victim again, or the abuser will find new victims. In this case the police had a call from a close family member accusing the person of domestic abuse. They had suspicious behavior from the accused person. They also witnessed that the possible victim had multiple injuries consistent with domestic abuse. As well as the arm injury the call from the family member had initially reported. But probably no charges or at least no convictions. reply myrmidon 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Where is OP not being truthful?

I think Lit has the no build process captured pretty well and they include things such as a router. I do prefer the style of of your components more, where you separate out the script and styles with html tags. I don&#x27;t know if one way or the other is superior for performance, I but just like the separation verse the templated strings in Lit. With build tools being so straightforward now-a-days, I struggle to see the value in the build less approach. One use case I can think of is maybe a constrained environment where the application contains some kind of customizable user components fully in the browser like a reporting WYSIWIG of some kind. Is there a particular reason you prefer this approach? reply lelanthran 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Is there a particular reason you prefer this approach? Compared to Lit? Firstly, I like Lit. My approach is better for me because there are far fewer things to know in order to create a reusable object and there are far fewer things to know in order to use an existing object. IOW, my approach trades off functionality in favour of a lower cognitive burden for me. I just wanted something that had the minimum functionality I need - create an object and then reuse it. For me, anything outside of that goal is peripheral burden that I&#x27;d rather not get bogged down in. I agree with many here that this is not an approach for them , maybe even for most , but I am certain that if I find something useful that increases my velocity of feature delivery, then maybe someone else will as well. reply cosmic_cheese 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] With the caveat that I’m generally outside of the web dev sphere aside from casual tinkering: no build process means no setup and one fewer thing that can break. That’s valuable in itself. reply dfabulich 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Zjs is a web component for doing client-side includes. The Zjs code itself is itself a web component that extends HTMLElement and registers itself as &lt;zjs-component&gt;. It&#x27;s only 100 lines long. In its connectedCallback, it fetches the URL of the &quot;remote-src&quot; attribute, and injects its content in innerHTML. Client-side includes are bad. The industry avoids them, for good reasons. First, they hurt performance. The client can&#x27;t start downloading a zjs-component content until its connectedCallback runs. If a zjs-component includes another zjs-component, the client can&#x27;t start downloading the nested component until its parent component downloads and executes. If your components are nested at N layers, this means that the page won&#x27;t finish loading until N serial non-parallelizable requests succeed. On cellular networks, where network latency can be measured in seconds, if you have four layers of components, you&#x27;re looking at adding 10+ seconds to page load. Second, each client-side include will cause a layout shift, as the &lt;zjs-component&gt; element starts out at 0px tall, and then will change in height as the component loads. This is bad. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;articles&#x2F;cls Finally, in your article, you claim that reactivity is &quot;out of scope for a component creation mechanism,&quot; but there is no universally recognized &quot;scope&quot; for component creation. You&#x27;d need to justify the claim that reactivity is out of scope. If you think reactivity matters at all, then you&#x27;d need to demonstrate how to use client-side includes in the context of a framework that does provide reactivity. HTMX is a lightweight framework that provides a reactivity framework around client-side includes. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmx.org&#x2F; You might especially appreciate the academic theoretical framework the HTMX team provides in their book, Hypermedia Systems. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypermedia.systems&#x2F; HTMX is pretty good for what it does; it&#x27;s not clear that anyone should prefer ZJS over HTMX for anything.

I will do my best to address them: &gt; Client-side includes are bad. The industry avoids them, for good reasons. The industry we are talking about does lots of things that has caused many to consider &quot;the industry&quot; to be something of a running joke. You may not like client-side includes, but it really is something useful to have. Wanting to have client-side includes and not wanting to spin up an entire tech stack of 5 or so different technologies is not unreasonable. &gt; First, they hurt performance. [...] On cellular networks, where network latency can be measured in seconds, if you have four layers of components, you&#x27;re looking at adding 10+ seconds to page load. 1. The first time, sure. It&#x27;s 10s the first time those 4 components are downloaded. Any other component using any of those 4 components on the rest of that page, or if that page is reloaded, will have a 0s download. 2. On cellular networks I currently get longer wait times than that for SPAs used by the mainstream frameworks anyway today . I&#x27;m not losing any sleep over the pathological cases which affect mainstream frameworks and libraries as well. 3. I call it pathological because I feel that it would be an extreme case to have lots of components being downloaded, of which only a few get reused. The whole point to reusing is so that the component only gets downloaded once, even if used in multiple places. &gt; Second, each client-side include will cause a layout shift, as the &lt;zjs-component&gt; element starts out at 0px tall, and then will change in height as the component loads. This is bad. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;articles&#x2F;cls I agree. It&#x27;s a trade-off that many sites currently make, SPAs included. While I find it incredibly annoying, this component is for when that trade-off decision is already made . &gt; Finally, in your article, you claim that reactivity is &quot;out of scope for a component creation mechanism,&quot; but there is no universally recognized &quot;scope&quot; for component creation. You&#x27;d need to justify the claim that reactivity is out of scope. I&#x27;m a bit confused about this; if there is no universally recognised &quot;scope&quot; for creation of an object in an OO environment, why would I have to first define what scope is and then defend that decision? Most (all?) mainstream OO approaches don&#x27;t have reactivity within scope for the definition of an object, so I feel that any claim that reactivity is within scope for this specific OO approach needs to provide some sort of reason why that an exception must be made for zjs-component so that it is measured against a higher bar than other OO approaches. &gt; HTMX is a lightweight framework that provides a reactivity framework around client-side includes. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmx.org&#x2F; You might especially appreciate the academic theoretical framework the HTMX team provides in their book, Hypermedia Systems. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypermedia.systems&#x2F; I&#x27;ve read those. Regardless, if you are building an SPA with Facebook level number of components, then this is not for you. IOW, this may not suit your use-case, or even most of your use-cases.

If Angular is the &quot;Google blessed&quot; way of writing Web Components and Angular makes a terrible hash of it, who can build good Web Components? Angular and a couple other well known frameworks were targeting for far too long pre-spec Google-specific versions of Web Components and Web Components moved quickly past that and settled into cross-vendor specs with smarter defaults and simpler APIs a lot of the marketing damage was already done that Web Components were too complex and too poorly supported. So much of the Web Components world is stuck with the quagmire of the Shadow DOM, and while there are some generalized use cases for the Shadow DOM, I have the harsh opinion that the Shadow DOM was mostly invented to be &quot;better IFRAMES for Ad Publishers&quot; and not much else. I don&#x27;t think enough web developers yet realize that the Shadow DOM is entirely optional and its complexity is so much easier to ignore and toss than to try to utilize. &gt; focused on pulling in the good things from the framework world (i.e. what happened with jQuery), but they didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m coming to the growing opinion that between Web Components and the TEMPLATE tag Browser vendors have finally caught up with some of the best ideas of the Knockout-era &quot;Progressive Enhancement&quot; world, assuming you ignore the Shadow DOM as mostly YAGNI. Sure, a lot of cross-component communication and some of state management goes back to DOM APIs and DOM event management, but there used to be a lot of knowledge in those areas and maybe it past time to return to Vanilla JS ideas about some of that. In the time since jQuery and Knockout, all browsers today have much more consistent DOM APIs for event management, at least. (Similar for routing. Vanilla routing, even &quot;SPA&quot; routing is easier than ever with modern APIs, even the API not fully standardized and cross-browser yet, but also the improved APIs for hash navigation. Also, Web Components seem a great reminder that MPA routing is great and brilliant, and so well tested in browsers and servers. With View Transitions now generally well supported, and getting better, many MPAs feel as good or better than SPAs even.) (And I feel like most styling problems with Web Components are self-inflicted with and by the Shadow DOM. It&#x27;s nice to embrace the cascade again, if you can.) I was bullish on Web Components for a while, but most of my complaints have disappeared in recent months, and especially in realizing that I was very happy ignoring everything about the Shadow DOM. Sure, I&#x27;m not using Web Components without a &quot;framework&quot; but I&#x27;m using a far smaller &quot;view engine&quot; than a React or Angular, a lot more &quot;Vanilla&quot;, and feeling a bit like it&#x27;s a Revenge of Knockout sort of era. reply spankalee 1 minute ago | root | parent | next [–] Angular has nothing to do with web components.

My approach is, actually, an attempt to inject some Vanilla into front-end component development. reply WorldMaker 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] I think many of us, as this linked article that kicked off this discussion included, are thinking of various ways of using more Vanilla approaches. I appreciate the above poster&#x27;s complaints that we aren&#x27;t in some promised land of being able to do things 100% Vanilla without some form of reactivity management. That&#x27;s still all in progress, no matter where you are in the Observables versus Signals &quot;debate&quot;, Browsers are back to showing interest in native specs for one or both. (I personally think Signals are just &quot;worse, poorly encapsulated Observables&quot;, but either proposal is a good building block for whatever the next steps are and thinner libraries to build on top of them will be.) But Web Components are mostly some steps in the right direction, I think, while that other work remains ongoing. I also like gradual typing too much to expect to be 100% Vanilla any time soon. Typescript is too handy a verification&#x2F;testing tool and while I&#x27;m still watching the native type stripping proposal with TC-39 with a lot of interest, it&#x27;s certainly not on a fast track. reply willmeyers 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] For anyone curious, the source code: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lelanthran&#x2F;ZjsComponent&#x2F; reply lacoolj 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] This kinda reminds me of a slimmed down version of Polymer.

How doé ZjsComponent compare, any advantage with your paradigm? reply sandreas 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] I like vanilla components... Personally I think that instead of providing either frameworks or vanilla compnents, frameworks should provide a way to compile components to independant vanilla JS (similar to svelte not needing a &quot;runtime&quot;). This way it would not matter this much how you deploy components and this compiling step could probably have its own API with hooks and callbacks. reply notnullorvoid 11 minutes ago | parent | next [–] Older Svelte versions may not have needed a runtime, but Svelte 5 definitely does.

I think Lit has the no build process captured pretty well and they include things such as a router. I do prefer the style of of your components more, where you separate out the script and styles with html tags. I don&#x27;t know if one way or the other is superior for performance, I but just like the separation verse the templated strings in Lit. With build tools being so straightforward now-a-days, I struggle to see the value in the build less approach. One use case I can think of is maybe a constrained environment where the application contains some kind of customizable user components fully in the browser like a reporting WYSIWIG of some kind. Is there a particular reason you prefer this approach? reply lelanthran 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Is there a particular reason you prefer this approach? Compared to Lit? Firstly, I like Lit. My approach is better for me because there are far fewer things to know in order to create a reusable object and there are far fewer things to know in order to use an existing object. IOW, my approach trades off functionality in favour of a lower cognitive burden for me. I just wanted something that had the minimum functionality I need - create an object and then reuse it. For me, anything outside of that goal is peripheral burden that I&#x27;d rather not get bogged down in. I agree with many here that this is not an approach for them , maybe even for most , but I am certain that if I find something useful that increases my velocity of feature delivery, then maybe someone else will as well. reply cosmic_cheese 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] With the caveat that I’m generally outside of the web dev sphere aside from casual tinkering: no build process means no setup and one fewer thing that can break. That’s valuable in itself. reply dfabulich 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Zjs is a web component for doing client-side includes. The Zjs code itself is itself a web component that extends HTMLElement and registers itself as &lt;zjs-component&gt;. It&#x27;s only 100 lines long. In its connectedCallback, it fetches the URL of the &quot;remote-src&quot; attribute, and injects its content in innerHTML. Client-side includes are bad. The industry avoids them, for good reasons. First, they hurt performance. The client can&#x27;t start downloading a zjs-component content until its connectedCallback runs. If a zjs-component includes another zjs-component, the client can&#x27;t start downloading the nested component until its parent component downloads and executes. If your components are nested at N layers, this means that the page won&#x27;t finish loading until N serial non-parallelizable requests succeed. On cellular networks, where network latency can be measured in seconds, if you have four layers of components, you&#x27;re looking at adding 10+ seconds to page load. Second, each client-side include will cause a layout shift, as the &lt;zjs-component&gt; element starts out at 0px tall, and then will change in height as the component loads. This is bad. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;articles&#x2F;cls Finally, in your article, you claim that reactivity is &quot;out of scope for a component creation mechanism,&quot; but there is no universally recognized &quot;scope&quot; for component creation. You&#x27;d need to justify the claim that reactivity is out of scope. If you think reactivity matters at all, then you&#x27;d need to demonstrate how to use client-side includes in the context of a framework that does provide reactivity. HTMX is a lightweight framework that provides a reactivity framework around client-side includes. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmx.org&#x2F; You might especially appreciate the academic theoretical framework the HTMX team provides in their book, Hypermedia Systems. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypermedia.systems&#x2F; HTMX is pretty good for what it does; it&#x27;s not clear that anyone should prefer ZJS over HTMX for anything.

I appreciate the above poster&#x27;s complaints that we aren&#x27;t in some promised land of being able to do things 100% Vanilla without some form of reactivity management. That&#x27;s still all in progress, no matter where you are in the Observables versus Signals &quot;debate&quot;, Browsers are back to showing interest in native specs for one or both. (I personally think Signals are just &quot;worse, poorly encapsulated Observables&quot;, but either proposal is a good building block for whatever the next steps are and thinner libraries to build on top of them will be.) But Web Components are mostly some steps in the right direction, I think, while that other work remains ongoing. I also like gradual typing too much to expect to be 100% Vanilla any time soon. Typescript is too handy a verification&#x2F;testing tool and while I&#x27;m still watching the native type stripping proposal with TC-39 with a lot of interest, it&#x27;s certainly not on a fast track. reply willmeyers 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] For anyone curious, the source code: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lelanthran&#x2F;ZjsComponent&#x2F; reply lacoolj 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] This kinda reminds me of a slimmed down version of Polymer.

Personally I think that instead of providing either frameworks or vanilla compnents, frameworks should provide a way to compile components to independant vanilla JS (similar to svelte not needing a &quot;runtime&quot;).

Regular zstd compressed files consist of a single frame, meaning you have to start decompression at the beginning. The seekable format splits compressed data into a series of independent frames, each compressed individually, so that decompression of a section in the middle of an archive only requires zstd to decompress at most a frame&#x27;s worth of extra data, instead of the entire archive. I started working with the seekable format because I wanted to resume downloads of big zstd compressed files that are decompressed and written to disk on the fly. At first I created and used bindings to the C functions that are available upstream[1], however, I stumbled over the first segfault rather quickly (it&#x27;s now fixed) and found out that the functions only allow basic things. After looking closer at the upstream implementation, I noticed that is uses functions of the core API that are now deprecated and it doesn&#x27;t allow access to low-level (de)compression contexts. To me it looks like a PoC&#x2F;demo implementation that isn&#x27;t maintained the same way as the zstd core API, probably that&#x27;s also the reason it&#x27;s in the contrib directory. My use-case seemed to require a complete rewrite of the seekable format, so I decided to implement it from scratch in Rust using bindings to the advanced zstd compression API, available from zstd 1.4.0. The result is a single dependency library crate[2], and a CLI crate[3] for the seekable format that feels similar to the regular zstd tool. Any feedback is highly appreciated!

We do this already for xz: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;libguestfs.org&#x2F;nbdkit-xz-filter.1.html https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rwmj.wordpress.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;nbdkit-xz-curl&#x2F; Has zstd actually standardized the seekable version? Last I checked (which was quite a while ago) it had not been declared a standard, so I was reluctant to write a filter for nbdkit, even though it&#x27;s very much a requested feature. reply simeonmiteff 8 hours ago | prev | next [–] This is very cool. Nice work! At my day job, I have been using a Go library[1] to build tools that require seekable zstd, but felt a bit uncomfortable with the lack of broader support for the format. Why zeek, BTW? Is it a play on &quot;zstd&quot; and &quot;seek&quot;? My employer is also the custodian of the zeek project ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zeek.org ), so I was confused for a second. [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SaveTheRbtz&#x2F;zstd-seekable-format-go reply rorosen 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] Thanks! I was also surprised that there are very few tools to work with the seekable format. I could imagine that at least some people have a use-case for it. Yes, the name is a combination of zstd and seek. Funnily enough, I wanted to name it just zeek first before I knew that it already exists, so I switched to zeekstd. You&#x27;re not the first person asking me if there is any relation to zeek and I understand how that is misleading. In hindsight the name is a little unfortunate. reply etyp 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Zeek is well known in &quot;security&quot; spaces, but not as much in &quot;developer&quot; spaces. It did get me a bit excited to see Zeek here until I realized it was unrelated, though :) reply mbreese 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] I’m trying to learn more about the seekable zstd format. I don’t know very much about zstd, aside from reading the spec a few weeks ago. But I thought this was part of the spec? IIRC, zstd files don’t have to have just one frame. Is the norm to have just one large frame for a file and the multiple frame version just isn’t as common? Gzip can also have multiple “frames” concatenated together and be seamlessly decrypted. Is this basically the same concept? As mentioned by others bgzip uses this feature of gzip to great effect and is the standard compression in bioinformatics because of it (and is sadly hard coded to limit other potentially useful Gzip extensions). My interest is to see if using zstd instead of gzip as a basis of a format would be beneficial. I expect for there to be better compression, but I’m skeptical if it would be enough to make it worthwhile. reply teraflop 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] The Zstd spec allows a stream to consist of multiple frames, but that alone isn&#x27;t enough for efficient seeking. You would still need to read every frame header to determine which compressed frame corresponds to a particular byte offset in the uncompressed stream. &quot;Seekable Zstd&quot; is basically just a multi-frame Zstd stream, with the addition of a &quot;seek table&quot; at the end of the file which contains the compressed and uncompressed sizes of every other frame. The seek table itself is marked as a skippable frame, so that seekable Zstd is backward-compatible with normal Zstd decompressors (the seek table is just treated as metadata and ignored). https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;zstd&#x2F;blob&#x2F;dev&#x2F;contrib&#x2F;seekable_f... reply mbreese 54 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Got it. That’s incredibly helpful. Thank you! The way that’s handled in the bgzip&#x2F;gzip world is with an external index file (.gzi) with compressed&#x2F;uncompressed offsets. The index could be auto-computed, but would still require reading the header for each frame. I vastly prefer the idea of having the index as part of the file. Sadly, gzip doesn’t have the concept of a skippable frame, so that would break naive decompressors. I’m still not sure the file size savings would be big enough to switch over to zstd, but I like the approach. reply stu2010 8 hours ago | prev | next [–] This is cool, I&#x27;d say that the most common tool in this space is bgzip[1]. Have you thought about training a dictionary on the first few chunks of each file and embedding the dictionary in a skippable frame at the start? Likely makes less difference if your chunk size is 2MB, but at smaller chunk sizes that could have significant benefit. [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.htslib.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;bgzip.html reply jeroenhd 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] Looking at the spec ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;zstd&#x2F;blob&#x2F;dev&#x2F;contrib&#x2F;seekable_f... ), I don&#x27;t see any mention of custom dictionaries like you describe. The spec does mention: &gt; While only Checksum_Flag currently exists, there are 7 other bits in this field that can be used for future changes to the format, for example the addition of inline dictionaries. so I don&#x27;t think seekable zstd supports these dictionaries just yet. With multiple inline dictionaries, one could detect when new chunks compress badly with the previous dictionary and train new ones on the fly. Could be useful for compressing formats with headers and mixed data (i.e. game files, which can contain a mix of text + audio + video, or just regular old .tar files I suppose). reply ikawe 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Custom dictionaries are a feature of vanilla (non-seekable) zstd.

It strikes me as being useful for genomic data, which is always stored in compressed chunks. That was the first time I really understood the hard trade-off between seek time and compression. reply threeducks 4 hours ago | prev | next [–] Assuming that frames come at a cost, how much larger are the seekable zstd files? Perhaps as a graph based on frame size and for different kinds of data (text, binaries, ...). reply mcraiha 4 hours ago | parent | next [–] It depends on content and compression options. ZSTD has four different compression methods: Raw literals, RLE literals, Compressed literals and Treeless literals. I assume that the last two might suffer the most if content is splitted. reply tyilo 7 hours ago | prev | next [–] I already use zstd_seekable ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;zstd-seekable&#x2F; ) in a project. Could you compare the API&#x27;s of this crate and yours? reply tyilo 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like you provide the equivalent of Seekable::decompress in zstd_seekable which decompresses at a specific offset, without having to calculate which frame(s) to decompress. This is basically the only function I use from zstd_seekable, so it would be nice to have that in zeekstd as well. reply ncruces 7 hours ago | prev | next [–] How&#x27;s tool support these days to create compress a file with seekable zstd? Given existing libraries, it should be really simple to create an SQLite VFS for my Go driver that reads (not writes) compressed databases transparently, but tool support was kinda lacking.

For example say you want to seek to 10MB into the uncompressed file. Do you need to store metadata separately to know how many frames to skip? reply teraflop 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] A seekable Zstd file contains a seek table, which contains the compressed and uncompressed size of all frames. That&#x27;s enough information to figure out which frame contains your desired offset, and how far into that frame&#x27;s decompressed data it occurs. reply rwmj 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Not sure about zstd, but in xz the blocks (frames in zstd) are stored across the file and linked by offsets into a linked list, so you can just scan over the compressed file very quickly at the start, and in memory build a map of uncompressed virtual offsets to compressed file positions. Here&#x27;s the code in nbdkit-xz-filter: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;nbdkit&#x2F;nbdkit&#x2F;-&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;filters&#x2F;xz&#x2F;xz... reply Imustaskforhelp 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] Seekable format is so cool!

And then kinda learned about criu and I think criu can technically do it but IDK, I in fact started to try to create the zip project in golang but failed it over... Pretty nice to know that zstd exists Its not a zip file but technically its compressed and I guess you can technically still encode the data in such a way that its essentially zip in some sense... This is why I come on hackernews. reply b0a04gl 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] how do you handle cases where the seek table itself gets truncated or corrupted? do you fallback to scanning for frame boundaries or just error out? wondering if there&#x27;s room to embed a minimal redundant index at the tail too for safety reply throebrifnr 7 hours ago | prev | next [–] Gz has --rsyncable option that does something similar.

This means that you can edit&#x2F;insert&#x2F;delete bytes in the middle of the uncompressed input, and the compressed output will only have a few compressed blocks change. reply andrewaylett 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] zstd also has an rsyncable option -- as an example of when it&#x27;s useful, I take a dump of an SQLite database (my Home Assistant DB) using a command like this: sqlite3 -readonly &quot;${i}&quot; .dump | zstd --fast --rsyncable -v -o &quot;${PART}&quot; - The DB is 1.2G, the SQL dump is 1.4G, the compressed dump is 286M.

However, high-performance open-source RISC-V cores face adoption challenges: some (e.g. BOOM, Xiangshan) are developed in Chisel with limited support from industrial electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Others, like the XuanTie C910 core, use proprietary interfaces and protocols, including non-standard AXI protocol extensions, interrupts, and debug support. In this work, we present a modified version of the OoO C910 core to achieve full RISC-V standard compliance in its debug, interrupt, and memory interfaces. We also introduce CVA6S+, an enhanced version of the dual-issue, industry-supported open-source CVA6 core. CVA6S+ achieves 34.4% performance improvement over CVA6 core. We conduct a detailed performance, area, power, and energy analysis on the superscalar out-of-order C910, superscalar in-order CVA6S+ and vanilla, single-issue in-order CVA6, all implemented in a 22nm technology and integrated into Cheshire, an open-source modular SoC. We examine the performance and efficiency of different microarchitectures using the same ISA, SoC, and implementation with identical technology, tools, and methodologies. The area and performance rankings of CVA6, CVA6S+, and C910 follow expected trends: compared to the scalar CVA6, CVA6S+ shows an area increase of 6% and an IPC improvement of 34.4%, while C910 exhibits a 75% increase in area and a 119.5% improvement in IPC. However, efficiency analysis reveals that CVA6S+ leads in area efficiency (GOPS/mm2), while the C910 is highly competitive in energy efficiency (GOPS/W). This challenges the common belief that high performance in superscalar and out-of-order cores inherently comes at a significant cost in area and energy efficiency.

seekable_format.md     View all files Repository files navigation README BSD-2-Clause license Zeekstd A Rust implementation of the Zstandard Seekable Format. The seekable format splits compressed data into a series of independent "frames", each compressed individually, so that decompression of a section in the middle of an archive only requires zstd to decompress at most a frame's worth of extra data, instead of the entire archive. Zeekstd makes additions to the seekable format by implementing an updated version of the specification , however, it is fully compatible with the initial version of the seekable format . Compression A seekable Encoder will start new frames automatically at 2MiB of uncompressed data. See EncodeOptions to change this and other compression parameters. use std :: { fs :: File , io } ; use zeekstd :: Encoder ; fn main ( ) -&gt; zeekstd :: Result &lt; ( ) &gt; { let mut input = File :: open ( "data" ) ? ; let output = File :: create ( "seekable.zst" ) ? ; let mut encoder = Encoder :: new ( output ) ? ; io :: copy ( &amp; mut input , &amp; mut encoder ) ? ; // End compression and write the seek table to the end of the seekable encoder . finish ( ) ? ; Ok ( ( ) ) } Decompression By default, the seekable Decoder decompresses everything, from the first to the last frame, but can also be configured to decompress only specific frames. use std :: { fs :: File , io } ; use zeekstd :: Decoder ; fn main ( ) -&gt; zeekstd :: Result &lt; ( ) &gt; { let input = File :: open ( "seekable.zst" ) ? ; let mut output = File :: create ( "decompressed" ) ? ; let mut decoder = Decoder :: new ( input ) ? ; // Decompress everything io :: copy ( &amp; mut decoder , &amp; mut output ) ? ; let mut partial = File :: create ( "partial" ) ? ; // Decompress only specific frames decoder . set_lower_frame ( 2 ) ; decoder . set_upper_frame ( 5 ) ; io :: copy ( &amp; mut decoder , &amp; mut partial ) ? ; Ok ( ( ) ) } CLI This repo also contains a CLI tool that uses the library.

This model is trained to understand document structure and content context (like tables, equations, images, plots, watermarks, checkboxes, etc.). Key Features: LaTeX Equation Recognition Converts inline and block-level math into properly formatted LaTeX, distinguishing between $...$ and $$...$$. Image Descriptions for LLMs Describes embedded images using structured &lt;img&gt; tags. Handles logos, charts, plots, and so on. Signature Detection &amp; Isolation Finds and tags signatures in scanned documents, outputting them in &lt;signature&gt; blocks. Watermark Extraction Extracts watermark text and stores it within &lt;watermark&gt; tag for traceability. Smart Checkbox &amp; Radio Button Handling Converts checkboxes to Unicode symbols like , , and for reliable parsing in downstream apps. Complex Table Extraction Handles multi-row&#x2F;column tables, preserving structure and outputting both Markdown and HTML formats.

Or would bigger, hosted multimodal LLMs work better in such case? reply generalizations 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Does it have a way to extract the images themselves, or is that still a separate process later? reply j45 27 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] If you are after extracting images from pdfs there’s plenty of tools that do that just fine without LLMs. reply generalizations 21 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] I mean, ideally it would be in context, so the generated markdown references the correct image at the correct location in the doc. Unless that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re talking about? In which case I don&#x27;t know about those tools. reply temp0826 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] I have a Shipibo (indigenous Peruvian language) to Spanish dictionary that I&#x27;ve been trying to translate into a Shipibo to English dictionary using a couple different llms but keep struggling with formatting (two columns, strange line breaks, but also both Shipibo and Spanish in the definitions make it difficult to grok). That all plus being pretty poorly scanned. May need to give this a try. reply el_don_almighty 7 hours ago | prev | next [–] I have been looking for something that would ingest a decade of old Word and PowerPoint documents and convert them into a standardized format where the individual elements could be repurposed for other formats. This seems like a critical building block for a system that would accomplish this task. Now I need a catalog, archive, or historian function that archives and pulls the elements easily. Amazing work! reply pxc 3 hours ago | parent | next [–] Can&#x27;t you just start with unoconv or pandoc, then maybe use an LLM to clean up after converting to plain text? reply ks2048 7 hours ago | prev | next [–] It’s a shame all these models target markdown and not something with more structure and a specification. There are different flavors of Markdown and limited support for footnotes, references, figures, etc. reply souvik3333 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] Actually, we have trained the model to convert to markdown and do semantic tagging at the same time. Eg, the equations will be extracted as LaTeX equations, and images (plots, figures, and so on) will be described within the `&lt;img&gt;` tags. Same with `&lt;signature&gt;`, `&lt;watermark&gt;`, &lt;page_number&gt;. Also, we extract the tables as HTML tables instead of markdown for complex tables. reply mgr86 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Have you considered XML. TEI, for example, is very robust and mature for marking up documents. reply esafak 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] First I heard of it. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Text_Encoding_Initiative reply mgr86 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Understandable. I work in academic publishing, and while the XML is everywhere crowd is graying, retiring, or even dying :( it still remains an excellent option for document markup. Additionally, a lot of government data produced in the US and EU make heavy use of XML technologies. I imagine they could be an interested consumer of Nanonets-OCR. TEI could be a good choice as well tested and developed conversions exist to other popular, less structured, formats. reply agoose77 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Do check out MyST Markdown ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mystmd.org )! Academic publishing is a space that MyST is being used, such as https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elementalmicroscopy.com&#x2F; via Curvenote.

One of my &quot;litmus test&quot; papers is this old paper on a Fortran inverse-Laplace transform algorithm [1] that intersperses inline and display equations, and monospace code blocks, while requiring OCR from scratch, and very few models currently do a satisfactory job, i.e. in the following page transcribed by Marker, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;Q7UYIfW the inline $\sigma_0$ is mangled as &quot;&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; 0&quot;, and $f(t)$ is mangled as &quot; f~ ~t*!&quot;.

So it should work fine. This is the reason we predict the table in HTML instead of markdown. reply nehalem 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Thank you. I was rather thinking of magazine like layouts with columns of text and headers and footers on every page holding article title and page number. reply souvik3333 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It should work there also. We have trained on research papers with two columns of text. Generally, papers have references as a footer and contains page number. reply b0a04gl 5 hours ago | prev | next [–] the interesting bit is it&#x27;s tagging semantics during parsing itself. knowing something&#x27;s a signature or watermark or checkbox before layout reconstruction. most pipelines bolt that on later using heuristics or classifiers. &gt; curious what that pre-tagging does to downstream simplification, especially for converting into json&#x2F;html without extra passes. &gt;also wondering how they handle ambiguity in visual cues without layout metadat reply raus22 14 hours ago | prev | next [–] With models like these, when multilingual is not mentioned it will perform really bad on real life non-english pdfs. reply souvik3333 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] The model was primarily trained on English documents, which is why English is listed as the main language. However, the training data did include a smaller proportion of Chinese and various European languages. Additionally, the base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-3B) is multilingual. Someone on Reddit mentioned it worked on Chinese: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;LocalLLaMA&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1l9p54x&#x2F;comment... reply silversmith 14 hours ago | prev | next [–] I&#x27;m curious, how does it do with non-english texts?

Because my experience is not at all like that. If I use both Google Translate and ChatGPT on an image, ChatGPT is pretty much always better.

My understanding: - Weight available: You can download the weights. - Open weight: You can download the weights, and it is licensed freely (e.g. public domain, CC BY-SA, MIT). - Open source: (Debated) You can download the weights, it is licensed freely, and the training dataset is also available and licensed freely. For context: &gt; You&#x27;re right. The Apache-2.0 license was mistakenly listed, and I apologize for the confusion. Since it&#x27;s a derivative of Qwen-2.5-VL-3B, it will have the same license as the base model (Qwen RESEARCH LICENSE AGREEMENT). Thanks for pointing this out. reply gardnr 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Interestingly, another OCR model based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B just dropped which also publishes as Apache 2.

We have a benchmark for evaluating VLM on document understanding tasks: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idp-leaderboard.org&#x2F; . But unfortunately, it does not include image to markdown as a task. The problem with evaluating an image to markdown is that even if the order of two blocks are different, it can still be correct. Eg: if you have both seller info and buyer info side by side in the image one model can extract the seller info first, and another model can extract the buyer info first. Both model will be correct but depending on the ground truth if you do fuzzy matching one model will have higher accuracy than the other one. Normally, a company will train and test on a dataset that is trained on the same type of annotation (either left block first or right block first), and all other models can get a low score on their benchmark because they are trained on the opposite order of annotations. reply tensor 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The more important thing to me with any VLM is base OCR performance and hallucinations. It&#x27;s not too hard to get improved average accuracy on very low quality scans using language models. Unfortunately these also typically produce large numbers of hallucinations, which are a deal breaker if you are trying to get out values for financial or legal purposes. OCR that has lower accuracy, but where the inaccurate parts are left blank or flagged are far superior. Mistral OCR also suffers from this problem. If your OCR produced bounding boxes for every text line, and ran a traditional OCR on the text, this could alleviate it. Or at the very least bounding boxes let users cross-correlate with output from traditional OCR. Also a small note, it&#x27;s probably best not to say your product beats Mistral when it&#x27;s not even tested against it. Having more features doesn&#x27;t make a product better if the accuracy is not better on those features. I don&#x27;t mean to be discouraging, this is an important space and it looks like you have a very feature rich model. I&#x27;d like to see a good solution be developed! reply krapht 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If this is the only issue, can&#x27;t this be addressed by normalizing the post-processed data before scoring?

I tested your file locally seems to be working correctly. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;C36RRjYs Regarding the token limit, it depends on the text. We are using the qwen-2.5-vl tokenizer in case you are interested in reading about it. You can run it very easily in a Colab notebook.

Nanonets-OCR-s is packed with features designed to handle complex documents with ease: LaTeX Equation Recognition: Automatically converts mathematical equations and formulas into properly formatted LaTeX syntax. It distinguishes between inline ( $...$ ) and display ( $$...$$ ) equations. Intelligent Image Description: Describes images within documents using structured &lt;img&gt; tags, making them digestible for LLM processing. It can describe various image types, including logos, charts, graphs and so on, detailing their content, style, and context. Signature Detection &amp; Isolation: Identifies and isolates signatures from other text, outputting them within a &lt;signature&gt; tag. This is crucial for processing legal and business documents. Watermark Extraction: Detects and extracts watermark text from documents, placing it within a &lt;watermark&gt; tag. Smart Checkbox Handling: Converts form checkboxes and radio buttons into standardized Unicode symbols ( ☐ , ☑ , ☒ ) for consistent and reliable processing. Complex Table Extraction: Accurately extracts complex tables from documents and converts them into both markdown and HTML table formats. 📢 Read the full announcement | 🤗 Hugging Face Space Demo Usage Using transformers from PIL import Image from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoProcessor, AutoModelForImageTextToText model_path = "nanonets/Nanonets-OCR-s" model = AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained( model_path, torch_dtype= "auto" , device_map= "auto" , attn_implementation= "flash_attention_2" ) model. eval () tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path) processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_path) def ocr_page_with_nanonets_s ( image_path, model, processor, max_new_tokens= 4096 ): prompt = """Extract the text from the above document as if you were reading it naturally.

The trust of peer review as a stamp of quality among academics is dwindling, and distrust of science among the population is growing (within the increasing politicisation of some areas of research). Transparent peer review raises the bar for both academics and enhances the potential trust in the process. This is desperately needed as AI could further deteriorate the quality of science if the publishing process is not made more strict. This represents a significant step forward in rigorous science. I hope other publications follow suit. reply eig 40 minutes ago | prev | next [–] A good step forward. Reading the referee reports and rebuttals from papers that previously opted in to transparent reviewing was incredibly useful to my own paper publishing process. In many ways Nature is ahead of Science on this. I hope that making things transparent will help reduce the situation where big labs have an easier time getting their work into high impact journals through relationships with the editor. reply dr_dshiv 41 minutes ago | prev | next [–] We need more scientific societies. Modern peer review is super modern. Go back to the origins of science and it was all about a real community—setting high standards and having just a few people decide what to publish. It wasn’t trying to be “objective” — it was just high standards, determined invisibly by the members of the society. “Should we publish this?” asked the society. Alas, scale ruins everything. Nevertheless, I strongly believe “science is friendship” reply aDyslecticCrow 29 minutes ago | parent | next [–] That model had some major issues. Too many opposing theories to the &quot;established norm&quot; were dismissed, among things we now know were wrong all along. Although it could raise the standard of the process itself (methodology, writing) to very high levels, it restricted innovative ideas or unpopular outcomes. reply striking 16 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] Sounds like a recipe for serious inequity to me. reply jostmey 57 minutes ago | prev [–] This only addresses a small part of the problem with peer-review. The real problem is that peer reviewers can’t possibly replicate the study, and so are forced to look for inconsistencies in the papers. If the paper doesn’t fit what is expected, it will often be rejected. This can also lead to self-reinforcing views that ignore contrarian data.

The trust of peer review as a stamp of quality among academics is dwindling, and distrust of science among the population is growing (within the increasing politicisation of some areas of research). Transparent peer review raises the bar for both academics and enhances the potential trust in the process. This is desperately needed as AI could further deteriorate the quality of science if the publishing process is not made more strict. This represents a significant step forward in rigorous science. I hope other publications follow suit. reply eig 40 minutes ago | prev | next [–] A good step forward. Reading the referee reports and rebuttals from papers that previously opted in to transparent reviewing was incredibly useful to my own paper publishing process. In many ways Nature is ahead of Science on this. I hope that making things transparent will help reduce the situation where big labs have an easier time getting their work into high impact journals through relationships with the editor. reply dr_dshiv 41 minutes ago | prev | next [–] We need more scientific societies. Modern peer review is super modern. Go back to the origins of science and it was all about a real community—setting high standards and having just a few people decide what to publish. It wasn’t trying to be “objective” — it was just high standards, determined invisibly by the members of the society. “Should we publish this?” asked the society. Alas, scale ruins everything. Nevertheless, I strongly believe “science is friendship” reply aDyslecticCrow 29 minutes ago | parent | next [–] That model had some major issues. Too many opposing theories to the &quot;established norm&quot; were dismissed, among things we now know were wrong all along. Although it could raise the standard of the process itself (methodology, writing) to very high levels, it restricted innovative ideas or unpopular outcomes. reply striking 16 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] Sounds like a recipe for serious inequity to me. reply jostmey 57 minutes ago | prev [–] This only addresses a small part of the problem with peer-review. The real problem is that peer reviewers can’t possibly replicate the study, and so are forced to look for inconsistencies in the papers. If the paper doesn’t fit what is expected, it will often be rejected. This can also lead to self-reinforcing views that ignore contrarian data. Also, the data can be made up, and if it makes sense to the reviewers, it is generally not questioned reply aDyslecticCrow 21 minutes ago | parent | next [–] Bad quality work is a much bigger problem than dishonest work.

If you haven&#39;t seen dk in action, the Quick Walkthrough Guide will explain what dk scripts are and give you small examples to run. Developers who are ready to script with dk should explore the dk Runtime to check which versions of Windows , macOS , and Linux are supported for your users. Developers who are writing scripts should first consult dk Parties for how to organize your scripts in a project, and then keep a copy of the dk Libraries and dk Macros reference manuals open while editing their scripts.

Twitter Facebook Email You have full access to this article via your institution. A published research paper is the result of an extensive conversation between authors and reviewers, guided by editors. Credit: Getty Since 2020, Nature has offered authors the opportunity to have their peer-review file published alongside their paper . Our colleagues at Nature Communications have been doing so since 2016 . Until now, Nature authors could opt in to this process of transparent peer review. From 16 June, however, new submissions of manuscripts that are published as research articles in Nature will automatically include a link to the reviewers’ reports and author responses. It means that, over time, more Nature papers will include a peer-review file. The identity of the reviewers will remain anonymous, unless they choose otherwise — as happens now. But the exchanges between the referees and the authors will be accessible to all. Our aim in doing so is to open up what many see as the ‘black box’ of science, shedding light on how a research paper is made. This serves to increase transparency and (we hope) to build trust in the scientific process. Research evaluation needs to change with the times As we have written previously , a published research paper is the result of an extensive conversation between authors and reviewers, guided by editors. These discussions, which can last for months, aim to improve a study’s clarity and the robustness of its conclusions. It is a hugely important process that should receive increased recognition, including acknowledgement of the reviewers involved, if they choose to be named. For early-career researchers, there is great value in seeing inside a process that is key to their career development. Making peer-reviewer reports public also enriches science communication: it’s a chance to add to the ‘story’ of how a result is arrived at, or a conclusion supported, even if it includes only the perspectives of authors and reviewers. The full story of a paper is, of course, more complex, involving many other contributors. Many people think of science as something fixed and unchanging. But scientific knowledge evolves as new or more-nuanced evidence comes to light. Scientists constantly discuss their results, yet these debates are not contained in research papers and often remain unreported in wider science-communication efforts. Three-year trial shows support for recognizing peer reviewers The COVID-19 pandemic provided a brief interlude during which much of the world got to see how research works, almost in real time . It’s easy to forget that, right from the start, we were continuously learning something new about the nature and behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. On television screens, in newspapers and on social media worldwide, scientists were discussing among themselves and with public audiences the nature of the virus, how it infects people and how it spreads. They were debating treatments and prevention methods, constantly adjusting everyone’s knowledge as fresh evidence came to light . And then, it went mostly back to business as usual. We hope that publishing the peer-reviewer reports of all newly submitted Nature papers shows, in a small way, that this doesn’t need to remain the case. Nature started mandating peer review for all published research articles only in 1973 ( M. Baldwin Notes Rec. 69 , 337–352; 2015 ). But the convention in most fields is still to keep the content of these peer-review exchanges confidential. That has meant that the wider research community, and the world, has had few opportunities to learn what is discussed. Peer review improves papers. The exchanges between authors and referees should be seen as a crucial part of the scientific record, just as they are a key part of doing and disseminating research. doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-01880-9 Reprints and permissions Related Articles Nature is trialling transparent peer review — the early results are encouraging Research evaluation needs to change with the times Three-year trial shows support for recognizing peer reviewers Transparent peer review for all Subjects Peer review Authorship Publishing Latest on: Peer review How to spot suspicious papers: a sleuthing guide for scientists News 10 JUN 25 How our student journal club built on sand developed strong foundations Career Column 09 JUN 25 Fake AI images will cause headaches for journals Nature Index 27 MAY 25 Authorship Gender equality in research publishing is a responsibility for everyone Editorial 30 MAY 25 P hacking — Five ways it could happen to you Career Column 08 MAY 25 The do’s and don’ts of scientific image editing Technology Feature 29 APR 25 Publishing Recording my research led to a photojournalism career Career Q&amp;A 13 JUN 25 How to spot suspicious papers: a sleuthing guide for scientists News 10 JUN 25 How our student journal club built on sand developed strong foundations Career Column 09 JUN 25 Jobs NORPOD Collaborative Postdoctoral Programme by Nordic EMBL Partnership for Molecular Medicine The Nordic EMBL Partnership is seeking postdoctoral fellows for collaborative projects in molecular medicine through the third NORPOD call.

I just don&#x27;t want to believe that our services have to be paid for through proxy by giving huge cut to 3rd parties. The quality goes down both as UX and as core content, our attention span is destroyed, our privacy is violated and our political power is being stolen as content gets curated by those who extract money by giving us the &quot;free&quot; services. It&#x27;s simply very inefficient. IMHO we should go back to pay for what you use, this can&#x27;t go on forever. There must be way to turn everything into a paid service where you get what you paid for and have your lives enhanced instead of monetized by proxy. reply filoleg 6 hours ago | parent | next [–] I don’t have the actual stats, but, sadly, it seems like a gigantic chunk of the “i would rather pay a small fee to use a service rather than paying for it with exposure to ads” crowd is mostly all-talk. And I am saying this as someone who genuinely believes in the “small fee instead of paying with ad exposure” approach. The one specific example of this that made me think so is the Youtube Premium situation. So many people in the “a fee instead of ads” crowd consumes YT for hours a day, but so far I’ve only met one person (not counting myself) who actually pays for YT Premium. And yes, a major chunk of the people I talked about this with were FAANG engineers, so it isn’t like they cannot afford it. But it felt like they were more interested in complaining about the ad-funded-services landscape and muse on their stances around it, as opposed to actually putting their money where their mouth is. All I can say is, I am not paying for YT Premium out of some ideological standpoint or love for Google (not even close). It has genuinely been just worth it for me many times over in the exact practical ways I was expecting it to. reply Workaccount2 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] By far the choice of most marginally savvy and above internet users is an ad-model where they themselves ad-block.

That&#x27;s because micropayments are still fucking annoying to do on both sides of any transaction: - credit cards: cheap-ish at scale (2-5%), but users don&#x27;t want to give random apps their CC details and integrating with Stripe&#x2F;Paypal&#x2F;whatever has the cost of UX flow break due to account details and 2FA compliance bullshit. In addition, every service paid-for by CC has the problem that only people with a CC can pay for it (so people in countries like Europe where &quot;classic&quot; bank accounts prevail are out of luck, and so are people in countries deemed too poor and&#x2F;or fraud-affiliated are locked out entirely), and you gotta deal with tax and other regulatory compliance around handling payments as well. Oh and people will try to use your service to validate stolen payment credentials because a 1$ charge (especially for a well known service like Whatsapp) is most likely to be ignored by the accountholder even if fraudulent in nature, which in turn will lead to issues with chargebacks or, worst case, getting dropped entirely by the payment processor. - in-app purchases: expensive (30% cut for the platform provider), serious headache to do when a significant chunk of the user base doesn&#x27;t run phones with properly licensed Google Play Store (e.g. Huawei who aren&#x27;t allowed to embed Play Store on their phones) - bank transfer: possible, but restricted to the economic zones where there&#x27;s enough customer base to justify the expenses of setting up a local company with a bank account (i.e. US, EU, India, possibly China), and transaction fees from the banks may end up being &gt;&gt;50% of the transaction&#x27;s face value at such low amounts - crxptxcurrency: even more of a hassle for customers to acquire, questionable legality &#x2F; KYC issues, no realtime authorization due to mandatory waiting time for mining to confirm transactions - pay by phone bill, premium numbers: possible, but need bureaucracy in each country, fraud &#x2F; &quot;my kid did it&quot; complaints will run rampant, premium number calls are by default blocked in most if not all modern phone contracts ever since the early &#x27;00s and &quot;dialer&quot; fraud malware, difficult to associate with customer&#x27;s phone number in the backend In the end, if you truly want to capture a global audience with microtransaction payments, be prepared to deal with a loooooooooooooooooot of bullshit just to get started. Long story short, we desperately need a global government effort to standardize payments at low fees. There&#x27;s absolutely zero reason why banks and other intermediaries should be allowed to skim off more than 5% of any kind of transaction. ZERO. reply UnreachableCode 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Europe isn&#x27;t a country. And we have credit cards here. reply throw0101c 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; I don’t have the actual stats, but, sadly, it seems like a gigantic chunk of the “i would rather pay a small fee to use a service rather than paying for it with exposure to ads” crowd is mostly all-talk. Depends on the price. I&#x27;m guessing lots of folks are paying $1&#x2F;month to Apple to upgrade from the free 5GB tier of iCloud storage to get to the 50GB tier. WhatsApp charged people $1 per year before being acquired by Facebook: * https:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;whatsapp-subscription&#x2F; Supposedly about a billion people paid for that at the time. Even if they went to $1 per month, that&#x27;d be fairly cheap (and WhatsApp ran fairly lean, personnel-wise: fifty FTEs). reply toast0 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Supposedly about a billion people paid for that at the time. (I worked for WhatsApp from 2011-2019) From that article, user count was about 900 Million when the fee was ended; user count was about 450 M in Feb 2014 when the acquisition was announced [1]. Either way, it is a mistake to think everyone was paying. A) Some people still had lifetime accounts from when the app was $1 for iPhone, or from the typical late December limited time free for iPhone promotions. Windows Phone got marked as lifetime for a while due to a bug&#x2F;oversight that took a while to get noticed. B) Enforcement was limited. A lot of users wouldn&#x27;t have had a payment method that WhatsApp could accept; demanding payment when there&#x27;s no way to pay isn&#x27;t good for anybody. For a long time, we didn&#x27;t even implement payment enforcement; we&#x27;d go through and extend subscriptions for a year, initially by manual script, then through automation. When we did build payment enforcement, I think we only set it on for Spain and maybe the US. Everywhere else would get the reminders that the account was going to expire, and then on the day of, it would silently extend the account and not bug you again for a while. Even where payment enforcement was on, it would only lock you out for I think a week, then your account would be extended and maybe you&#x27;d pay next time. Adding on, for a lot of users, the hassle of paying $1 is a bigger deal than the actual $1; but so for people in lower income countries, it&#x27;s both --- a) it&#x27;s hard to pay $1 to a US country for a large number of people, b) there are countries with significant number of people living on a dollar a day; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to ask them to forgo a days worth of living to pay for a messenger. I don&#x27;t remember numbers, and there&#x27;s not a lot of financial reporting, because WhatsApp numbers are so small compared to the rest of FB&#x2F;Meta, but there&#x27;s a first half 2014 report [2] that shows revenue of $15M. Assuming payments are even over the year (probably not a good assumption, but we don&#x27;t have good numbers), that&#x27;d be maybe 30 Million paying users (some users bought multiple years though), or less than 10%.

What I was talking about was paying by being exposed to ads vs. paying directly, and increased iCloud storage has no former option. reply Workaccount2 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I can say from experience and from others who have been in this position (not email, but general services); its around 1-2% of people. Nebula, the answer to the tyranny of Youtube (who works for advertisers), has a &lt;1% conversion rate despite tons of huge Youtubers pushing it. Vid.me, the previous answer to youtubes tyranny, went bankrupt because people hate ads and also hate subscriptions, nor do they donate. I could write pages about this, but I wish I could violently shake all the children (many who are now in their 40&#x27;s) that so deeply feel entitled to free content on the internet, and scream &quot;If you are not paying directly for the product, you have no right to complain about the product&quot; . In reality the ad model is not going anywhere. Given the choice, people overwhelmingly chose to let the advertisers steer the ship if it means &quot;free&quot; entry. reply benhurmarcel 48 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] I pay for Nebula and still use Youtube a ton. Nebula is nice but it doesn’t have all channels I watch. reply paxys 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Video is impossible to break into because of how expensive it is. Even YouTube by all accounts is just breaking even. And that is with Google&#x27;s entire infrastructure and advertising machinery behind it. A new entrant simply doesn&#x27;t stand a chance. reply carlosjobim 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Hold on... A ton of broadcasters, production companies, and individuals have done it and are doing it. YouTube have many competitors and some of them are enormous, such as Netflix and cable TV. Production companies are popping up all the time and are making some of the world&#x27;s highest quality material. The same for individuals who are making videos. Or do you mean that YouTube needs a competitor that does exactly the same thing as YouTube? reply paxys 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] All of them are based on the traditional media production model. The companies were all well established in the industry (minus Netflix) and the only change was to go from broadcast&#x2F;cable&#x2F;theater to streaming. YouTube pioneered user generated videos and independent content creators. Its only competitor is probably Twitch, but that itself is owned by Amazon and losing a ton of money. reply carlosjobim 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] All of them have the technical infrastructure to host user uploaded videos, so it&#x27;s not impossible to compete with YouTube. reply Workaccount2 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] No one does video even remotely close to the scale YT does it. YT has by far the deepest market penetration (close to 3 billion monthly users), and has by far the most hosted content, and critically, youtube adds over a half-million hours of video a day. Essentially, youtube adds more video every single day than the entirety of every other streaming service offers combined. Youtube is in it&#x27;s own category, and it&#x27;s unsurprising no else wants to touch it. reply carlosjobim 25 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Counted in number of hours watched, I&#x27;m pretty sure that Netflix, cable TV and satellite TV, can compete with YouTube. But everybody has to start somewhere. Would it be impossible for Netflix to start adding for example 100 000 hours of user generated video per day? reply 9283409232 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Nebula just doesn&#x27;t have a product I want. I don&#x27;t care for early access to Youtube videos. reply doix 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I remember WhatsApp costing money, 1$ per year or per lifetime or something. I paid for it, I think it was a WinRar situation though, where deleting and reinstalling the app gave it to you for free or something. I&#x27;m guessing most people didn&#x27;t pay though, since they scraped the fee (even before FB bought them). I guess it was just too little money to be worth the effort. reply roryirvine 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Other way round. Facebook bought them in 2014, and they dropped the fee in early 2016. The fee wasn&#x27;t enforced in many developing countries, and some users elsewhere will have been jumping through the delete-and-reinstall hoops (which was painful because it lost chat history) to avoid paying. But with 1bn active users at the time the fee was dropped, it would still have been bringing in more than enough revenue to have sustained Whatsapp as an independent business if they had chosen not to sell to FB. reply A_Duck 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yep I paid for Whatsapp, I&#x27;ve even dug out the receipt email. I want my £0.79 back! reply Ekaros 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Three years of WhatsApp service for phone just 2,67$... In 2015... So I think I got that... reply mschuster91 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Pre acquisition Whatsapp had 450M users. Even accounting for half the revenue of 1$ going away for payment fees (30%) and taxes (20%), that would still have been a nice cushy 200 million $ a year in almost pure profit - WA had 55 (!) employees at acquisition and 550 servers [1]. That&#x27;s nothing at this scale of users and speaks volumes for the ingenuity of their staff. The only ones driving even leaner than that are StackOverflow with just nine servers [2].

There must be some some number that makes it viable to have free users and paid users. For games, the free users are usually those who provide the &quot;content&quot;. People usually demonize freemium games but IMHO its much more benign than extracting huge sums by artificially making it worse and sell attention. reply blitzar 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Most of those are tricked into it by manipulative UI or nearly impossible to cancel trials or forgotten monthly subscriptions. reply mrtksn 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] How is it possible to have impossible to cancel trails? On AppStore it&#x27;s in your account and takes 2 taps to cancel regardless of what the developer does. Are you talking for direct, by credit card payments that somehow you can&#x27;t cancel? Can you explain a bit? reply blitzar 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The abuse was so rampant that even the US has had to legislate. US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) introduced a new regulation, known as the “click to cancel” rule. As for the darkest of dark patterns - give Adobe some money and see what happens. reply mrtksn 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Right, my rule of thumb is to stick with AppStore and when that&#x27;s not an option use a Virtual card that I can just abandon if I don&#x27;t want to use the service. reply 1oooqooq 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] you&#x27;re being too generous, as if people were on whatsbook because of a value they get. they are just there for the captive network effect, which will take a hit the second or becomes a freemium or ad ridden service. reply xp84 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, nobody uses Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, or Google anymore now that they’re “ad-ridden” reply 1oooqooq 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] it&#x27;s probably under 0% even including the 2% error margin. reply blitzar 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Rounding up reply barnabee 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I’d love to know the expected ad revenue per user for makers of apps like WhatsApp, Instagram. I’m pretty convinced I’d pay 10x or more than that amount for a completely ad free version but I can’t be sure. reply xp84 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Don’t underestimate how expensive ads are and thus how much money they can bring in. Marco Arment, the developer of Overcast podcast player, has made remarks in the past about how the ad-supported version is completely viable and may actually make him more money per user than the price of his paid option. In his case, he runs his own contextual ad system. Obviously Meta is in a completely different league in terms of sophistication, meaning they are probably able to sell more targeted ads which means more money, and they also have the luxury of not having to pay any middlemen since they own their own ad infrastructure as well. Part of me thinks the reason why they don’t offer that paid ad-free version of Facebook (which they built to try and appease the EU regulators) in the US is because their ARPU is so high that people would laugh at the price “Facebook&#x2F;IG Premium” would have to cost. Also, don’t forget that at least for now, paid subscriptions to social media apps would need to pay a 30% rent to the platform owner duopoly. This means that the price it would be it would cost would need to be 42% above than its ad ARPU just to break even. reply detaro 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I&#x27;m not sure if the number was for Facebook specifically or all Meta apps, but they did quote a number of around $70 revenue per year per US user a while ago. (with (much) lower numbers in other parts of the world) reply disgruntledphd2 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] These numbers are actually kinda interesting, in that they&#x27;re based on user location, not advertiser. So basically all global companies target the US first because it&#x27;s a big market with consistent regulations and mostly one language (compare to the EU where you&#x27;d need English&#x2F;German&#x2F;French&#x2F;Spanish&#x2F;Polish and still would miss a lot). So, those numbers reflect a capital inflow to the US market rather than (as many people think) absurdly high conversion US users. Meta stopped reporting user numbers&#x2F;CPMs by geography after the market freaked out when user growth plateaued in the US (because they&#x27;d acquired basically everyone). reply detaro 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; So, those numbers reflect a capital inflow to the US market rather than (as many people think) absurdly high conversion US users. But the capital inflow is also because there is a lot of consumer spending in the US to convert. reply barnabee 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That’s interesting, thanks reply owebmaster 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You would not, because 90% of the years wouldn&#x27;t pay and you wouldn&#x27;t also to have nobody to talk to after everybody moves to the next chat app reply barnabee 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Why would users who can continue to receive exactly the same experience as today leave because some other users can opt to pay to go ad-free? reply irjustin 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This is only true if they introduce them. i.e. FB doesn&#x27;t have a paid service, but obviously Youtube does. The problem is Whatsapp is a closed ecosystem so unlike email we can&#x27;t just buy a provider. And I do pay for youtube. The experience is well worth it and I&#x27;m thankful I can afford it (it&#x27;s not a lot but many can&#x27;t). reply xp84 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] “Can’t” is relative. I suspect there are a lot of people who pay for at least one streaming service that isn’t YouTube, but spend more hours watching YouTube in a month than they do watching that service. And of course there’s also the age-old comparison that if someone goes to Starbucks more than twice in a month, they probably spend more there than you would on YouTube Premium, and does that provide the person with as much value as YouTube does? In my opinion, it’s rarely about “can’t” when we’re talking about 12 bucks a month or whatever. It’s about the psychology: when a free tier exists, people reframe it in their heads that paying for that thing is an extravagance. Relatedly, removing the free tier altogether also has dangerous effects, as people immediately jump to “I can’t believe you’re taking away the free thing I used to have” outrage, while nobody complains about not having free access to say, HBO. reply A_Duck 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The trouble with charging people is you have to charge everybody the same[1], so you&#x27;re leaving money on the table with wealthy users, and pricing out poorer users Ads mean each user &#x27;pays&#x27; you according to their spending power Kinda socialist when you think about it! From each according from his ability... [1] Obviously companies try to get around this with price discrimination, but it&#x27;s hard especially for a network effect platform reply xp84 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That is the absolute beauty of the targeted ad situation, isn’t it: you can generate leads for mortgages or expensive enterprise SaaS services, that are happy to pay super high acquisition costs, maximizing revenue from your rich users, and with the same ad inventory, maximize the revenue from your poor users by advertising App Store casino games for children, payday loans, etc. You can see why Meta doesn’t bother offering a paid service here. reply carlosjobim 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Most people go absolutely mentally deranged by a simple magical incantation. The powerful incantation or spell consists of only one word: &quot;Free&quot;. That word will make people loose their mind and their soul. It will make people accept anything and everything that they would never otherwise accept. They will line up for hours, they will accept hostile and toxic messages being screamed into their faces, they will humiliate themselves, they will spend sleepless nights, they will willingly enslave themselves, they will wither away in sickness, they will murder millions in the most cruel way imaginable. All for &quot;free&quot;. Societies in our history were not arranged in the same way around money, because probably there was some knowledge of the two-sided curse of avarice and stinginess. I&#x27;m talking about medieval and post-medieval society, where most people didn&#x27;t use or have money in their everyday life.

Even many businesses only use WhatsApp for orders and communications with customers. Heck, even the police use it to communicate between their people and with complainants&#x2F;victims. Politicians use it between their party people and to send messages to the public. The average person on the street no longer knows what an SMS is or how to use it. But I manage without WhatsApp (it’s also a privileged position to do so). Not having WhatsApp also helps avoid seeing all the junk and misinformation that people forward on it without any thought. There’s actually a name for this in India: “WhatsApp University”, which is a derogatory term for how people believe anything they read on WhatsApp and share it around without any analysis or thought or skepticism whatsoever. reply robertlagrant 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] &gt; When Facebook bought WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, the messaging app had a clear focus.

Ads will make more people Signal-curious, or even drive people back to text messages. The average person who switches will convince a non-zero number of their contacts to come with them. The shift will start gradually. Think of Skype, which at one point everyone I knew was on. That network didn&#x27;t protect them from being replaced by competitors.

It&#x27;s really hard to clean up media. You have to go into every single chat and from there go about deleting stuff. At least they finally added a &quot;select all&quot; option in there recently. So the size of it just grows and grows and grows until it&#x27;s using all the space on your phone. Not a good fit for non-technical types. Secondly, no web view.

People are pretty protective of their message history, and having everything tied to a single device with no recourse for backups is a nonstarter. The slightly longer version of the story is that my wife, travelling alone, had some trouble with an iPhone update (it hung for hours), and so she took it to the nearest Genius Bar; they eventually got the update to apply, but then did a factory reset “just to be safe”. Of course, everything except her Signal message history was restored from the automatic iCloud backups. She was devastated, and refuses to touch it now.

The quality goes down both as UX and as core content, our attention span is destroyed, our privacy is violated and our political power is being stolen as content gets curated by those who extract money by giving us the &quot;free&quot; services.

The one specific example of this that made me think so is the Youtube Premium situation. So many people in the “a fee instead of ads” crowd consumes YT for hours a day, but so far I’ve only met one person (not counting myself) who actually pays for YT Premium. And yes, a major chunk of the people I talked about this with were FAANG engineers, so it isn’t like they cannot afford it. But it felt like they were more interested in complaining about the ad-funded-services landscape and muse on their stances around it, as opposed to actually putting their money where their mouth is.

That&#x27;s because micropayments are still fucking annoying to do on both sides of any transaction: - credit cards: cheap-ish at scale (2-5%), but users don&#x27;t want to give random apps their CC details and integrating with Stripe&#x2F;Paypal&#x2F;whatever has the cost of UX flow break due to account details and 2FA compliance bullshit. In addition, every service paid-for by CC has the problem that only people with a CC can pay for it (so people in countries like Europe where &quot;classic&quot; bank accounts prevail are out of luck, and so are people in countries deemed too poor and&#x2F;or fraud-affiliated are locked out entirely), and you gotta deal with tax and other regulatory compliance around handling payments as well. Oh and people will try to use your service to validate stolen payment credentials because a 1$ charge (especially for a well known service like Whatsapp) is most likely to be ignored by the accountholder even if fraudulent in nature, which in turn will lead to issues with chargebacks or, worst case, getting dropped entirely by the payment processor. - in-app purchases: expensive (30% cut for the platform provider), serious headache to do when a significant chunk of the user base doesn&#x27;t run phones with properly licensed Google Play Store (e.g. Huawei who aren&#x27;t allowed to embed Play Store on their phones) - bank transfer: possible, but restricted to the economic zones where there&#x27;s enough customer base to justify the expenses of setting up a local company with a bank account (i.e. US, EU, India, possibly China), and transaction fees from the banks may end up being &gt;&gt;50% of the transaction&#x27;s face value at such low amounts - crxptxcurrency: even more of a hassle for customers to acquire, questionable legality &#x2F; KYC issues, no realtime authorization due to mandatory waiting time for mining to confirm transactions - pay by phone bill, premium numbers: possible, but need bureaucracy in each country, fraud &#x2F; &quot;my kid did it&quot; complaints will run rampant, premium number calls are by default blocked in most if not all modern phone contracts ever since the early &#x27;00s and &quot;dialer&quot; fraud malware, difficult to associate with customer&#x27;s phone number in the backend In the end, if you truly want to capture a global audience with microtransaction payments, be prepared to deal with a loooooooooooooooooot of bullshit just to get started. Long story short, we desperately need a global government effort to standardize payments at low fees. There&#x27;s absolutely zero reason why banks and other intermediaries should be allowed to skim off more than 5% of any kind of transaction.

Depends on the price. I&#x27;m guessing lots of folks are paying $1&#x2F;month to Apple to upgrade from the free 5GB tier of iCloud storage to get to the 50GB tier. WhatsApp charged people $1 per year before being acquired by Facebook: * https:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;whatsapp-subscription&#x2F; Supposedly about a billion people paid for that at the time. Even if they went to $1 per month, that&#x27;d be fairly cheap (and WhatsApp ran fairly lean, personnel-wise: fifty FTEs). reply toast0 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Supposedly about a billion people paid for that at the time. (I worked for WhatsApp from 2011-2019) From that article, user count was about 900 Million when the fee was ended; user count was about 450 M in Feb 2014 when the acquisition was announced [1]. Either way, it is a mistake to think everyone was paying. A) Some people still had lifetime accounts from when the app was $1 for iPhone, or from the typical late December limited time free for iPhone promotions. Windows Phone got marked as lifetime for a while due to a bug&#x2F;oversight that took a while to get noticed. B) Enforcement was limited. A lot of users wouldn&#x27;t have had a payment method that WhatsApp could accept; demanding payment when there&#x27;s no way to pay isn&#x27;t good for anybody. For a long time, we didn&#x27;t even implement payment enforcement; we&#x27;d go through and extend subscriptions for a year, initially by manual script, then through automation. When we did build payment enforcement, I think we only set it on for Spain and maybe the US. Everywhere else would get the reminders that the account was going to expire, and then on the day of, it would silently extend the account and not bug you again for a while. Even where payment enforcement was on, it would only lock you out for I think a week, then your account would be extended and maybe you&#x27;d pay next time. Adding on, for a lot of users, the hassle of paying $1 is a bigger deal than the actual $1; but so for people in lower income countries, it&#x27;s both --- a) it&#x27;s hard to pay $1 to a US country for a large number of people, b) there are countries with significant number of people living on a dollar a day; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to ask them to forgo a days worth of living to pay for a messenger. I don&#x27;t remember numbers, and there&#x27;s not a lot of financial reporting, because WhatsApp numbers are so small compared to the rest of FB&#x2F;Meta, but there&#x27;s a first half 2014 report [2] that shows revenue of $15M. Assuming payments are even over the year (probably not a good assumption, but we don&#x27;t have good numbers), that&#x27;d be maybe 30 Million paying users (some users bought multiple years though), or less than 10%.

I paid for it, I think it was a WinRar situation though, where deleting and reinstalling the app gave it to you for free or something. I&#x27;m guessing most people didn&#x27;t pay though, since they scraped the fee (even before FB bought them). I guess it was just too little money to be worth the effort. reply roryirvine 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Other way round. Facebook bought them in 2014, and they dropped the fee in early 2016. The fee wasn&#x27;t enforced in many developing countries, and some users elsewhere will have been jumping through the delete-and-reinstall hoops (which was painful because it lost chat history) to avoid paying. But with 1bn active users at the time the fee was dropped, it would still have been bringing in more than enough revenue to have sustained Whatsapp as an independent business if they had chosen not to sell to FB. reply A_Duck 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yep I paid for Whatsapp, I&#x27;ve even dug out the receipt email.

Marco Arment, the developer of Overcast podcast player, has made remarks in the past about how the ad-supported version is completely viable and may actually make him more money per user than the price of his paid option. In his case, he runs his own contextual ad system. Obviously Meta is in a completely different league in terms of sophistication, meaning they are probably able to sell more targeted ads which means more money, and they also have the luxury of not having to pay any middlemen since they own their own ad infrastructure as well. Part of me thinks the reason why they don’t offer that paid ad-free version of Facebook (which they built to try and appease the EU regulators) in the US is because their ARPU is so high that people would laugh at the price “Facebook&#x2F;IG Premium” would have to cost. Also, don’t forget that at least for now, paid subscriptions to social media apps would need to pay a 30% rent to the platform owner duopoly. This means that the price it would be it would cost would need to be 42% above than its ad ARPU just to break even. reply detaro 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I&#x27;m not sure if the number was for Facebook specifically or all Meta apps, but they did quote a number of around $70 revenue per year per US user a while ago.

So basically all global companies target the US first because it&#x27;s a big market with consistent regulations and mostly one language (compare to the EU where you&#x27;d need English&#x2F;German&#x2F;French&#x2F;Spanish&#x2F;Polish and still would miss a lot). So, those numbers reflect a capital inflow to the US market rather than (as many people think) absurdly high conversion US users. Meta stopped reporting user numbers&#x2F;CPMs by geography after the market freaked out when user growth plateaued in the US (because they&#x27;d acquired basically everyone). reply detaro 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; So, those numbers reflect a capital inflow to the US market rather than (as many people think) absurdly high conversion US users.

The problem is Whatsapp is a closed ecosystem so unlike email we can&#x27;t just buy a provider. And I do pay for youtube. The experience is well worth it and I&#x27;m thankful I can afford it (it&#x27;s not a lot but many can&#x27;t). reply xp84 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] “Can’t” is relative. I suspect there are a lot of people who pay for at least one streaming service that isn’t YouTube, but spend more hours watching YouTube in a month than they do watching that service. And of course there’s also the age-old comparison that if someone goes to Starbucks more than twice in a month, they probably spend more there than you would on YouTube Premium, and does that provide the person with as much value as YouTube does? In my opinion, it’s rarely about “can’t” when we’re talking about 12 bucks a month or whatever. It’s about the psychology: when a free tier exists, people reframe it in their heads that paying for that thing is an extravagance. Relatedly, removing the free tier altogether also has dangerous effects, as people immediately jump to “I can’t believe you’re taking away the free thing I used to have” outrage, while nobody complains about not having free access to say, HBO. reply A_Duck 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The trouble with charging people is you have to charge everybody the same[1], so you&#x27;re leaving money on the table with wealthy users, and pricing out poorer users Ads mean each user &#x27;pays&#x27; you according to their spending power Kinda socialist when you think about it!

But I manage without WhatsApp (it’s also a privileged position to do so). Not having WhatsApp also helps avoid seeing all the junk and misinformation that people forward on it without any thought.

It installs itself like a VPN and filters dns requests to ad domains using lists from the same sources as the adblockers.

By George Musser June 13, 2025 A new argument explores how the growth of disorder could cause massive objects to move toward one another. Physicists are both interested and skeptical. Comment Save Article Read Later DVDP Introduction By George Musser Contributing Writer June 13, 2025 View PDF/Print Mode fundamental physics gravity physics quantum gravity space-time theoretical physics thermodynamics All topics Isaac Newton was never entirely happy with his law of universal gravitation. For decades after publishing it in 1687, he sought to understand how, exactly, two objects were able to pull on each other from afar. He and others came up with several mechanical models, in which gravity was not a pull, but a push. For example, space might be filled with unseen particles that bombard the objects on all sides. The object on the left absorbs the particles coming from the left, the one on the right absorbs those coming from the right, and the net effect is to push them together. Those theories never quite worked, and Albert Einstein eventually provided a deeper explanation of gravity as a distortion of space and time. But Einstein’s account, called general relativity, created its own puzzles , and he himself recognized that it could not be the final word. So the idea that gravity is a collective effect — not a fundamental force, but the outcome of swarm behavior on a finer scale — still compels physicists. Earlier this year, a team of theoretical physicists put forward what might be considered a modern version of those 17th-century mechanical models. “There’s some kind of gas or some thermal system out there that we can’t see directly,” said Daniel Carney of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who led the effort. “But it’s randomly interacting with masses in some way, such that on average you see all the normal gravity things that you know about: The Earth orbits the sun, and so forth.” This project is one of the many ways that physicists have sought to understand gravity, and perhaps the bendy space-time continuum itself, as emergent from deeper, more microscopic physics. Carney’s line of thinking, known as entropic gravity, pegs that deeper physics as essentially just the physics of heat. It says gravity results from the same random jiggling and mixing up of particles — and the attendant rise of entropy, loosely defined as disorder — that governs steam boilers, car engines and refrigerators. Daniel Carney, a theoretical physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, spearheaded the latest attempt to explain gravity as an entropic force. The Regents of the University of California, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Attempts at modeling gravity as a consequence of rising entropy have cropped up now and again for several decades. Entropic gravity is very much a minority view. But it’s one that won’t die, and even detractors are loath to dismiss it altogether. The new model has the virtue of being experimentally testable — a rarity when it comes to theories about the mysterious underpinnings of the universal attraction. A Force Emerges What makes Einstein’s theory of gravity so remarkable is not just that it works (and does so with sublime mathematical beauty), but that it betrays its own incompleteness. General relativity predicts that stars can collapse to form black holes, and that, at the centers of these objects, gravity becomes infinitely strong. There, the space-time continuum tears open like an overloaded grocery bag, and the theory is unable to say what comes next. Furthermore, general relativity has uncanny parallels to heat physics, even though not a single thermal concept went into its development. It predicts that black holes only grow, never shrink, and only swallow, never disgorge. Such irreversibility is characteristic of the flow of heat. When heat flows, energy takes a more randomized or disordered form; once it does, it is unlikely to reorder itself spontaneously. Entropy quantifies this growth of disorder. Indeed, when physicists used quantum mechanics to study what happens in the distorted space-time around a black hole, they find that black holes give off energy like any hot body. Because heat is the random motion of particles, these thermal effects suggest to many researchers that black holes, and the space-time continuum in general, actually consist of some kind of particles or other microscopic components. The Unraveling of Space-Time fundamental physics The Unraveling of Space-Time September 25, 2024 Comment Save Article Read Later Following the clues from black holes , physicists have pursued multiple approaches to understanding how space-time emerges from more microscopic components. The leading approach takes off from what’s known as the holographic principle. It says the emergence of space-time works a bit like an ordinary hologram. Just as a hologram evokes a sense of depth from a wavy pattern etched onto a flat surface, patterns in the microscopic components of the universe may give rise to another spatial dimension. This new dimension is curved, so that gravity arises organically. Entropic gravity, introduced in a famous 1995 paper by the theoretical physicist Ted Jacobson of the University of Maryland, takes a related but distinct tack. Previously, physicists had started with Einstein’s theory and derived its heatlike consequences. But Jacobson went the other way. He started from the assumption that space-time has thermal properties and used these to derive the equations of general relativity. His work confirmed that there’s something significant about the parallels between gravity and heat. “He turned black hole thermodynamics on its head,” Carney said. “I’ve been mystified by this result for my entire adult life.” Apparent Attraction How might gravitational attraction arise out of more microscopic components? Inspired by Jacobson’s approach, Carney and his co-authors — Manthos Karydas , Thilo Scharnhorst, Roshni Singh and Jacob Taylor — put forward two models. In the first, space is filled with a crystalline grid of quantum particles, or qubits. Each has an orientation, like a compass needle. These qubits will align themselves with a nearby object that possesses mass and exert a force on that object. “If you put a mass somewhere in the lattice, it causes all of the qubits nearby to get polarized — they all try to go in the same direction,” Carney said. Carney and coauthors Roshni Singh, Jacob Taylor, Thilo Scharnhorst and Manthos Karydas (clockwise from top left) recently developed concrete models showing how the rise of entropy could cause objects to appear to attract one another. Timothy Michael Pinkhassik; T.  Ventsias/University of Maryland; Timothy Michael Pinkhassik; Sarah Wittmer/ UC Berkeley Physics By reorienting the nearby qubits, a massive object creates a pocket of high order in the grid of otherwise randomly oriented qubits. If you place two masses into the lattice, you create two such pockets of order. High order means low entropy. But the system’s natural tendency is to maximize entropy. So, as the masses realign the qubits and the qubits in turn buffet the masses, the net effect will be to squash the masses closer together to contain the orderliness to a smaller region. It will appear that the two masses are attracting each other gravitationally when in fact the qubits are doing all the work. And just as Newton’s law dictates, the apparent attraction diminishes with the square of the distance between the masses. The second model does away with the grid. Massive objects still reside within space and are acted upon by qubits, but now those qubits do not occupy any particular location and could in fact be far away. Carney said this feature is intended to capture the nonlocality of Newtonian gravity: Every object in the universe acts on every other object to some degree. Each qubit in the model is able to store some energy; the amount depends on the distance between the masses. When they are far apart, a qubit’s energy capacity is high, so the total energy of the system can fit in just a few qubits. But if the masses are closer together, the energy capacity of each qubit drops, so the total energy has to be spread over more qubits. The latter situation corresponds to a higher entropy, so the natural tendency of the system is to push the masses together, again in keeping with Newtonian gravity. Strengths and Weaknesses Carney cautioned that both models are ad hoc. There’s no independent evidence for these qubits, and he and his colleagues had to fine-tune the strength and direction of the force exerted by them. One might ask whether this is any improvement over taking gravity to be fundamental. “It actually seems to require a peculiar engineered-looking interaction to get this to work,” Carney said. And what works is just Newton’s law of gravity, not the full apparatus of Einstein’s theory, where gravity is equivalent to the curvature of space-time. For Carney, the models are just a proof of principle — a demonstration that it is at least possible for swarm behavior to explain gravitational attraction — rather than a realistic model for how the universe works. “The ontology of all of this is nebulous,” he said. Mark Van Raamsdonk , a physicist at the University of British Columbia, is doubtful that the models really represent a proof of principle. A practitioner of holography, the leading approach to emergent space-time, Van Raamsdonk notes that the new entropic models don’t have any of the qualities that make gravity special, such as the fact that you feel no gravitational force when you’re freely falling through space-time. “Their construction doesn’t really have anything to do with gravity,” he said. The physicist Angelo Bassi works on experiments that could be used to test entropic gravity models. University of Trieste Furthermore, the models dwell on the one aspect of gravity that physicists think they already understand. Newton’s law arises naturally out of Einstein’s theory when gravity is comparatively feeble, as it is on Earth. It’s where gravity gets strong, as in black holes, that it gets weird, and the entropic model has nothing to say about that. “The real challenge in gravitational physics is understanding its strong-coupling, strong-field regime,” said Ramy Brustein , a theorist at Ben-Gurion University who said he used to be sympathetic to entropic gravity but has cooled on the idea. Proponents of entropic gravity respond that physicists shouldn’t be so sure about how gravity behaves when it is weak. If gravity is indeed a collective effect of qubits, the Newtonian force law represents a statistical average, and the moment-by-moment effect will bounce around that average. “You have to go to very weak fields, because then these fluctuations might become observable,” said Erik Verlinde of the University of Amsterdam, who argued for entropic gravity in a much-discussed 2010 paper and has continued to develop the idea. Testing Entropic Gravity Carney thinks the main benefit of the new models is that they prompt conceptual questions about gravity and open up new experimental directions. Suppose a massive body is in a quantum combination, or “superposition,” of being in two different locations. Will its gravitational field likewise be in a superposition, pulling on falling bodies in two different directions? The new entropic-gravity models predict that the qubits will act on the massive body to snap it out of its Schrödinger’s cat–like predicament. Related: Why Gravity Is Not Like the Other Forces If the Universe Is a Hologram, This Long-Forgotten Math Could Decode It What Is Entropy? A Measure of Just How Little We Really Know. This scenario connects to the much-fretted-over question of wave function collapse — which asks how it is that measuring a quantum system in superposition causes its multiple possible states to become a single definite state. Some physicists have suggested that this collapse is caused by some intrinsic randomness in the universe. These proposals differ in detail from Carney’s but have similar testable consequences. They predict that an isolated quantum system will eventually collapse of its own accord, even if it’s never measured or otherwise affected from without. “The same experimental setups could, in principle, be used to test both,” said Angelo Bassi of the University of Trieste, who has led the effort to perform such experiments, already ruling out some collapse models . For all his doubts, Van Raamsdonk agrees that the entropic-gravity approach is worth a try. “Since it hasn’t been established that actual gravity in our universe arises holographically, it’s certainly valuable to explore other mechanisms by which gravity might arise,” he said. And if this long-shot theory does work out, physicists will need to update the artist Gerry Mooney’s famous gravity poster, which reads: “Gravity. It isn’t just a good idea. It’s the law.” Perhaps gravity is not, in fact, a law, just a statistical tendency. Share this article Facebook Copied!

https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2025/06/14/transitous-adding-data.html|Adding public transport data to Transitous|Adding public transport data to Transitous Volker Krause About Blog Talks Adding public transport data to Transitous 2025-06-14 • Volker Krause I had mentioned a number of new Transitous features in a previous post . As those largely depend on the corresponding data being available, here’s an overview of how you can help to find, add and improve that data. Transitous Transitous is a community-run public transport routing service build on top of the MOTIS routing engine and thousands of datasets from all over the world. Transitous backs public transport related features in applications like GNOME Maps , KDE Itinerary or Träwelling . Just like OpenStreetMap this needs people on the ground identifying issues or gaps in the data, figuring out where things go wrong and who to talk to at the local operators to get things fixed. The first step to help is just comparing data you get from Transitous with the reality around you, ie. does the public transport schedule match what’s actually happening, and are all relevant services included? If there’s things missing or outdated, a list of the types of datasets consumed by Transitous, and how to inspect and add those, follows below. The central part in this are a bunch of JSON files in the Transitous Git repository , which define all the datasets to be used as well as a few parameters and metadata for those. Once a day those are then retrieved, validated, filtered and post-processed for importing into MOTIS by Transitous’ import pipeline . Public transport schedules The backbone of public transport routing is static GTFS schedule data, that’s the bare minimum for Transitous to work in a region. GTFS feeds are essentially zip files containing a set of CSV tables, making them relatively easy to inspect, although especially nationwide aggregated feeds can get rather large. GTFS feeds ideally contain data for several months into the future, but can nevertheless receive regular updates. Transitous checks for updates daily, so for this to work practically we also need a stable URL for them (that might seem obvious to you, but apparently not to all feed providers…). We currently have more than 1800 of those, from 55 countries. The Transitous map view gives you an impression how well an area is covered, each of the colored markers there is an (estimated) current position of a public transport vehicle. Recently added coverage in South Korea. If your area is incomplete or not covered at all, the hardest part to change that is probably finding the corresponding GTFS feeds. There’s a few places worth looking at: The public transport operators themselves, they might just publish data on their website. Regional or national open data portals, especially in countries with regulation requiring public transport data to be published. In the EU, those are called “National Access Point” (NAP). GTFS feed registries such as Mobility Database and Transitland . Google Maps having public transport data in your region is a strong indicator whether GTFS feeds even exist, as they use those as well. Adding a GTFS feed to Transitous is then usually just a matter of a few lines of JSON pointing to the feed. In rare cases it might require a bit more automation work, such as in France where there’s hundreds of small feeds to manage. And every feed is welcome, no matter whether it’s a nation-wide railway operator or a single community-run bus to help people in a rural area, as long as it’s for a service open to the general public. Realtime data So far this is all static though. For properly dealing with delay, disruptions and all kinds of other unplanned and short-notice service changes we also need GTFS Realtime (RT) feeds. Those are polled once a minute for updates. GTFS-RT feeds come in three different flavors: Trip updates, that is realtime schedule changes like delays, cancellations, etc. Service alerts, that is textual descriptions of disruptions beyond a specific connection, such as upcoming construction work. Vehicle positions, that is geographic coordinates of the current position of trains or busses. MOTIS can handle the first two so far. Support for vehicle positions is also on the wishlist, and not just for showing current positions on a map, vehicle positions could also be used to interpolate trip updates when those are not available. Adding GTFS-RT feeds to Transitous is very similar to adding static GTFS feeds, however GTFS-RT feeds usually only work in combination with their respective static equivalent. Combining a smaller realtime feed of a single operator with a nationwide aggregated static feed will thus usually not work out of the box. There’s ways to exclude certain operators from a larger static feed though, so with a bit of puzzle work this can usually be made to work as well. GTFS-RT feeds use Protocol Buffers , but there’s nevertheless simple way to look at their content: curl https://the.feed.url | protoc gtfs-realtime.proto --decode = transit_realtime.FeedMessage | less The Protocol Buffers schema file needed for this can be downloaded here . To see the realtime coverage available in Transitous, you can toggle the color coding of vehicles on its map view in the upper right corner. A green/yellow/red gradient shows the amount of delay for the corresponding trip, while gray vehicles have no realtime information. Color-coded realtime data in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Shared mobility data Transitous doesn’t just handle scheduled public transport though, but also vehicle sharing, which can be particularly interesting for the first and last mile of a trip. The data for this is provided by GBFS feeds. This includes information about the type of vehicles (bikes, cargo bikes, kickscooters, mopeds, cars, etc) and their method of propulsion (human powered, electric, etc), where to pick them up and where to return them (same location as pickup, designated docks of the provider, free floating within a specific area, etc) and most importantly where vehicles are currently available. Adding GBFS feeds to Transitous is also just a matter of a few lines of JSON. We currently don’t have a built-in UI to see the results, showing all available vehicles on the map is certainly on the wishlist though. GBFS is relatively easy to inspect manually, the entry point is a small JSON manifest that contains links to JSON files with the actual information, generally split up by how often certain aspects are expected to change. Same as for GTFS feeds, any service accessible to the general public is welcome here, whether it’s a small community run OpenBike instance or a provider with hundreds of vehicles. On-demand services Somewhere between scheduled transport and shared mobility are on-demand services. That is, services that require some form or booking beforehand and might be anything from an on-demand bus that still follows a somewhat fixed route with pre-defined stops to something closer to a taxi with a more flexible route that picks up or drops off passengers anywhere in a given area. These services are often used in times and/or areas with fewer demand, thus making them often the only mobility option then/there. That makes it all the more important to have those covered as well. Modeling on-demand services is challenging, given the variety on how those services work and their inherently very dynamic nature. There’s the relatively new GTFS-Flex standard covering this, which MOTIS supports since v2.0.66. GTFS-Flex feeds might be included in static GTFS data or provided separately, and adding them to Transitous works again by just a few lines of JSON . There’s one caveat though, the validator we use in pre-processing, gtfsclean , doesn’t support GTFS-Flex yet, so those feeds are currently imported without any sanity checking or validation. Therefore we need to be extra careful with adding such feeds until that is fixed. If you know a bit of Go and want to help with that, get in touch ! For GTFS-Flex data there’s some diagnostic visualization in the map view in debug mode , when zooming in far enough. Diagnostic view of on-demand service areas in Switzerland. OSM A crucial dataset for all road-based and in-building routing is OpenStreetMap . While that is generally very comprehensive and up-to-date, there’s one aspect that more often needs fixes, the floor level separation. That’s not visible in most OSM-based maps and thus is easy to miss while mapping. For Transitous this is particularly important for in-building routing in train stations. When zoomed in enough the map view of Transitous will offer you a floor level selector at the lower right. That can give you a first indication if elements are misplaced (showing up on the wrong level) or not assigned to a floor level at all (showing up on all levels). For reviewing smaller elements indoor= can also be useful, and for fixing things JOSM has a built-in level selector on the top left. Railway tracks running through the passenger level of Bremen central station (upper right). In most cases adding or fixing the level tag is all that’s needed. Elements allowing to move between levels (stairs, ramps, elevators, escalators, etc) are especially important for routing. And more All of the above is just the current state, there’s much more to look at though, such as: Unused information in the existing datasets, such as fare information or the remaining range of sharing vehicles. Expanding the GTFS standard to cover things currently not modeled. Starting from relatively simple things like car ferries or car transport trains to highly detailed information about a bus or train interior with regards to accessibility. Convert other data formats to GTFS, such as NeTEx , SIRI or SSIM . Generate GTFS-RT trip updates from realtime vehicle position data. Extend the import pipeline to augment and normalize GTFS feeds, e.g. by injecting line colors and logos from Wikidata or accessibility information and missing paths from OSM, or to normalize train names. Considering elevation data for street routing. MOTIS has initial support for this meanwhile, but even the relatively coarse global 30m SRTM grid data would require an extra 50-100GB of (fast) storage, with quadratic growth with smaller grid sizes (1m or 2m grids are available in a number of regions). In other words, plenty of rabbit holes to explore, no matter whether you are into code, data, math, trains, busses, IT operations or lobby work :) You can help!

Our source code is now under the Apache License 2.0. For years, we wrestled with questions of sustainability and how to build something that truly empowers developers. We've long believed in open source philosophically, but felt that Darklang's unique architecture and business model required a different approach. Why We Initially Chose Source-Available We originally designed Darklang as a hosted-only platform where you'd code at darklang.com and programs would instantly be live in production. We believed this centralized approach was necessary for features like safe code migration and unified deployment, and that offering self-hosting would undermine our sustainability model. The core challenge was building something valuable while ensuring we could continue working on it long-term. Traditional open source funding models all had limitations, so Darklang was designed as "a language with a business model" - users with serious workloads would fund ecosystem development through our hosting platform. What Changed Our Thinking Three key shifts changed our perspective: Product maturity and user feedback : The real barrier to Darklang's adoption was never licensing - it was product maturity. As we've gotten closer to building something people love, staying source-available started feeling like an unnecessary risk. We consistently heard that people wanted us to be more open. Building for local-first development : Our technical direction evolved significantly. We're now building Darklang to run locally as a CLI, with the ability to deploy to our cloud or elsewhere. Nobody wants to run a proprietary language binary on their own machine. New business opportunities : The developer tools market has matured since 2017. We now see successful companies charging for team collaboration features and AI-powered tools while keeping the core platform accessible. These create value that teams are willing to pay for, while always having the option to self-host. Why Open Source Open source enables Darklang to be accessible, inspectable, and community-owned. It aligns with our philosophy of democratizing programming and ensures the platform can persist and evolve regardless of any single company's fate. We've learned how to deliver Darklang's key benefits - invisible infrastructure, deployless deployment, trace-driven development - without requiring our specific editor or hosting environment. This makes open source viable while preserving what makes Darklang special. Open Questions We're still exploring some interesting technical challenges around licensing in the Darklang ecosystem. GitHub handles this by attaching LICENSE.md files, but in a world where a package manager syncs types and functions directly, there are some neat challenges to think through. The core platform being open source gives us a solid foundation to build on. Comment on Hacker News , Twitter , Mastodon , Lobste.rs , LinkedIn Featured First Steps of Darklang Inc.

Long-shot idea gets another look | Hacker News Hacker News new | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login Is gravity just entropy rising? Long-shot idea gets another look ( quantamagazine.org ) 223 points by pseudolus 19 hours ago | hide | past | favorite | 198&nbsp;comments abetusk 4 hours ago | next [–] Entropic gravity is like the &quot;brazil nut effect&quot; [0] [1]. The idea is that if you shake a glass full of different sized nuts, the large ones will rise to the top. From what I understand, this is because larger objects have more mass, moving slower when shaked, so as the larger (brazil nuts) don&#x27;t move as much relative to the smaller ones (peanuts), and because of gravity, there&#x27;s a cavity left under the brazil nut which gets filled in with peanuts. For entropic gravity, the idea is that there&#x27;s a base density of something (particles? sub-atomic particles?) hitting objects in random ways from all directions. When two large massive objects get near each other, their middle region will have lower density thus being attracted to each other from particles hit with less frequency from the lower density region. They sort of cast a &quot;shadow&quot;. I&#x27;m no physicist but last time I looked into it there were assumptions about the density of whatever particle was &quot;hitting&quot; larger massive objects and that density was hard to justify. Would love to hear about someone more knowledgeable than myself that can correct or enlighten me. As an aside, the brazil nut effect is a very real effect. To get the raisins, you shake the raisin bran. To get gifts left from your cat, you shake the kitty litter. It works surprisingly well. [0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Granular_convection [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Incnv2CfGGM reply hellohello2 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] Not a physicist either but this passage from the Feynman lectures seem related to what you are describing: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu&#x2F;I_07.html &quot;Many mechanisms for gravitation have been suggested. It is interesting to consider one of these, which many people have thought of from time to time. At first, one is quite excited and happy when he “discovers” it, but he soon finds that it is not correct. It was first discovered about 1750. Suppose there were many particles moving in space at a very high speed in all directions and being only slightly absorbed in going through matter. When they are absorbed, they give an impulse to the earth. However, since there are as many going one way as another, the impulses all balance. But when the sun is nearby, the particles coming toward the earth through the sun are partially absorbed, so fewer of them are coming from the sun than are coming from the other side. Therefore, the earth feels a net impulse toward the sun and it does not take one long to see that it is inversely as the square of the distance—because of the variation of the solid angle that the sun subtends as we vary the distance. What is wrong with that machinery? It involves some new consequences which are not true. This particular idea has the following trouble: the earth, in moving around the sun, would impinge on more particles which are coming from its forward side than from its hind side (when you run in the rain, the rain in your face is stronger than that on the back of your head!). Therefore there would be more impulse given the earth from the front, and the earth would feel a resistance to motion and would be slowing up in its orbit. One can calculate how long it would take for the earth to stop as a result of this resistance, and it would not take long enough for the earth to still be in its orbit, so this mechanism does not work. No machinery has ever been invented that “explains” gravity without also predicting some other phenomenon that does not exist.&quot; reply AnotherGoodName 52 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] It also doesn&#x27;t account for time dilation in a gravity well however i still think the general idea has some merit if you think of it as being bombarded by massless ‘action potentials’ on all sides with mass absorbing that field to some to enable translation in space time. I get this is vague spitballing but essentially an ‘action potential’ would allow mass to move. Higher temperature mass interacts more, lower temperature interacts less. Mass with momentum would be biased to absorb more from one side so it travels in a specific direction in space more than others (the idea i’m getting at is that all movement in space only occurs with interaction with this field), this also would counteract issues with moving mass interacting more on a specific side - the very bias of mass with momentum to absorb more on one side means that from that masses point of view it has the same action potentials interacting from all sides. Mass shielded behind mass receives fewer action potentials so experiences exactly the effect that you can call time dilation. Mass shielding other mass from action potentials also means that mass accelerates towards other mass. Essentially its the above but instead of a massive particle hitting other mass from all sides it’s a field that allows mass to experience a unit of time. reply FilosofumRex 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This is a better YouTube video describing granular physics and shows the speed (amplitude) of vibrations can cause counterintuitive arrangements of particles. At lower speeds you get something akin to Newtonian gravity but at higher velocities you get something resembling MOND gravity where galaxies clusters and large voids appear - no dark matter needed. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HKvc5yDhy_4 reply abetusk 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Thanks for the link, very interesting. I&#x27;ll have to check out the paper but just watching the video it seems all these counter intuitive effects can be described from the oscillations being related to the size of the chamber. For example if I were to roll the chamber at a very low frequency, I would expect the particles to clump on one side, then the other and so on. This is not really so surprising and the frequency will depend on the chamber dimensions. reply Someone 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; From what I understand, this is because larger objects have more mass, moving slower when shaked, so as the larger (brazil nuts) don&#x27;t move as much relative to the smaller ones (peanuts) That doesn’t make sense to me. If larger objects move slower, don’t they move faster relative to the (accelerating) reference frame of the container? Also, conventional wisdom has it that shaking (temporarily) creates empty spaces, and smaller objects ‘need’ smaller such spaces to fall down, and thus are more likely to fall down into such a space. reply ndriscoll 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Aren&#x27;t more massive particles smaller though (in terms of de Broglie wavelength, at least), so they&#x27;d have a smaller &quot;shadow&quot;? Or do different forces have different cross-sections with different relationships to mass, so a particle&#x27;s &quot;size&quot; is different for different interactions (and could be proportional to mass for gravity)? Actually this is currently blowing my mind: does the (usual intro QM) wavefunction only describe the probability amplitude for the position of a particle when using photon interaction to measure , and actually a particle&#x27;s &quot;position&quot; would be different if we used e.g. interaction with a Z boson to define &quot;position measurement&quot;? reply bobbylarrybobby 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The momentum wavefunction (or more properly, the wavefunction in the momentum basis) completely determines the position wavefunction (wavefunction in the position basis). And we can probe the momentum wavefunction with any particle at all, by setting up identical (say) electrons and seeing the momentum they impart on a variety of test particles. That is to say, the probability distribution of momentum of a particle does not depend on what we use to probe it. As the position wavefunction is now completely determined in a probe-agnostic matter, it would be hard to justify calling a probe that didn&#x27;t yield the corresponding probability distribution a “position measurement”. reply hcarvalhoalves 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] In other words, gravity would be explainable by statistical mechanics (like heat)? reply abetusk 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] That&#x27;s the allure, that gravity is a derived effect from statistical mechanics.

To me, entropy is not a physical thing, but a measure of our imperfect knowledge about a system. We can only measure the bulk properties of matter, so we&#x27;ve made up a number to quantify how imperfect the bulk properties describe the true microscopic state of the system. But if we had the ability to zoom into the microscopic level, entropy would make no sense. So I don&#x27;t see how gravity or any other fundamental physical interaction could follow from entropy.

You can equally well apply your argument that it isn’t a physical thing because it doesn’t exist on a microscopic scale to temperature. Temperature doesn’t exist when you zoom in on single particles either. There’s no reason to involve our knowledge of the system.

Simple example: why ice melts in a warm room. More subtle example: why cords get tangled up over time. Our measures of entropy can be seen as a way of summarizing, at a macro level, the state of a system such as that warm room containing ice, or a tangle of cables, but the measure is not the same thing as the phenomenon it describes. Boltzmann&#x27;s approach to entropy makes the second law pretty intuitive: there are far more ways for a system to be disordered than ordered, so over time it tends towards higher entropy. That’s why ice melts in a warm room. reply aeonik 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] My take, for what it&#x27;s worth, Entropy isn’t always the driver of physical change, sometimes it’s just a map. Sometimes that map is highly isomorphic to the physical process, like in gas diffusion or smoke dispersion. In those cases, entropy doesn&#x27;t just describe what happened, it predicts it. The microstates and the probabilities align tightly with what’s physically unfolding. Entropy is the engine. But other times, like when ice melts, entropy is a summary , not a cause. The real drivers are bond energies and phase thresholds. Entropy increases, yes, but only because the system overcame physical constraints that entropy alone can’t explain. In this case, entropy is the receipt, not the mechanism. So the key idea is this: entropy’s usefulness depends on how well it “sees” the real degrees of freedom that matter. When it aligns closely with the substrate, it feels like a law. When it doesn&#x27;t, it’s more like coarse bookkeeping after the fact. The second law of thermodynamics is most “real” when entropy is the process. Otherwise, it’s a statistical summary of deeper physical causes. reply lumost 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] What makes entropy interesting is that you can describe many physical processes through analysis of the systems degrees of freedom. This pattern repeats regularly despite the systems being radically different. So you can interpret entropy as being about as real as potential energy or newtons laws.

How do you even define entropy for a system of 2 particles? The answer is that this doesn&#x27;t happen in a system with only 2 particles. The idea of gravity as an entropic phenomenon is that you introduce some other kind of particle that permeates spacetime, so there is no system that only contains 2 particles. You may use some idea like virtual particles from quantum field theory, or you may define &quot;quanta of space time&quot; as something that is not technically a particle but basically works like one in a handwavy sense. But the basic point of these entropy based theories is to explain gravity, and typcilaly spacetime itself, as an emergent result of a collection of numerous objects of some kind. This necessarily means that they don&#x27;t make sense if applied to idealized systems with very few objects - which is why they typically posit such isolated systems simply can&#x27;t actually exist in reality. reply ccozan 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Let me try to answer. Let&#x27;s say the particles are experiencing gravity as a natural entropy phenomena. They will attract until they become so close that they are now seen as a single particle. The new system has a lower entropy and a higher gravity than before. Explanation seems very rudimentary but that is the gist of the theory. From my point of view, I might add the layer of information density. Every quantum fluctuation is an event and the more particles the more information is produced in a defined space volume.

There is some tension between those claims. The latter seems to support the parent comment’s remark questioning whether a “fundamental physical interaction could follow from entropy”. It seems more appropriate to say that entropy follows from the physical interaction - not to be confused with the measure used to describe it. One may say that pressure is an entropic force and physical entropy governs the real physical process of gas expanding within a piston. However, one may also say that it’s the kinetic energy of the gas molecules what governs the physical process - which arguably is a more fundamental and satisfactory explanation. reply willvarfar 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The way we use the word &#x27;entropy&#x27; in computer science is different from how its used in physics.

You are absolutely right that entropy is always fundamentally a way to describe are our lack of perfect knowledge of the system [0]. Nevertheless there is a distinct &quot;reality&quot; to entropic forces, in the sense that it is something that can actually be measured in the lab. If you are not convinced then you can look at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Entropic_force and in particular the example that is always used in a first class on this topic: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ideal_chain So when viewed in this way entropy is not just a &quot;made-up thing&quot;, but an effective way to describe observed phenomena. That makes it useful for effective but not fundamental laws of physics. And indeed the wiki page says that entropic forces are an &quot;emergent phenomenon&quot;. Therefore, any reasonable person believing in entropic gravity will automatically call gravity an emergent phenomenon. They must conclude that there is a new, fundamental theory of gravity to be found, and this theory will &quot;restore&quot; the probabilistic interpretation of entropy. The reason entropic gravity is exciting and exotic is that many other searches for this fundamental theory start with a (more or less) direct quantization of gravity, much like one can quantize classical mechanics to arrive at quantum mechanics. Entropic gravity posits that this is the wrong approach, in the same way that one does not try to directly quantize the ideal gas law.

Anyone claiming otherwise is stuck in the nineteenth century, perhaps because they learned only thermodynamics but not statistical mechanics. reply meindnoch 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Sure, I&#x27;m not denying that entropy exists as a concept, that can be used to explain things macroscopically. But like you said, it&#x27;s origins are statistical. To me, temperature is also a similar &quot;made up&quot; concept. We can only talk about temperature, because a sufficiently large group of particles will converge to a single-parameter distribution with their velocities. A single particle in isolation doesn&#x27;t have a temperature. So if they say gravity might be an entropic effect, does that mean that they assume there&#x27;s something more fundamental &quot;underneath&quot; spacetime that - in the statistical limit - produces the emergent phenomenon of gravity? So it isn&#x27;t the entropy of matter that they talk about, but the entropy of something else, like the grains of spacetime of whatever. reply flufluflufluffy 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, exactly. The model is based on (in the first approach) a “lattice” of some type of undiscovered particle-like thing (what they refer to as “qubits” in the article, which is unfortunate because it is NOT the same “qubit” from quantum computing) permeating space time. Or maybe more aptly, it is that lattice from which spacetime emerges.

The second item doesn&#x27;t entail the first. Probabilities can be seen as a measure of lack of knowledge about a system, but it isn&#x27;t necessarily so. A phenomenon can also be inherently&#x2F;fundamentally probabilistic. For example, wave function collapse is, to the best of our knowledge, an inherently non-deterministic process. This is very relevant to questions about the nature of entropy - especially since we have yet to determine if it&#x27;s even possible for a large system to be in a non-collapsed state. If it turns out that there is some fundamental process that causes wave function collapse even in perfectly isolated quantum systems, then it would be quite likely that entropy is related to such a process, and that it may be more than a measure of our lack of knowledge about the internal state of a system, and instead a measurement of the objective &quot;definiteness&quot; of that state. I am aware that objective collapse theories are both unpopular and have some significant hurdles to overcome - but I also think that from a practical perspective, the gap between the largest systems we have been able to observe in pure states versus the smallest systems we could consider measurement devices is still gigantic and leaves us quite a lot of room for speculation. reply mjburgess 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Even if we take that view, gravity is still basically a similar case. What we call &quot;gravity&quot; is really an apparent force, that isnt a force at all when seen from a full 4d pov. Imagine sitting outside the whole universe from t=0,t=end and observing one whole block. Then the trajectories of matter, unaffected by any force at all, are those we call gravitational. From this pov, it makes a lot more sense to connect gravity with some orderly or disorderly features of these trajectories. Inertia, on this view, is just a kind of hysteresis the matter distribution of the universe has -- ie., a kind of remembered deformation that persists as the universe evolves. reply tsimionescu 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; From this pov, it makes a lot more sense to connect gravity with some orderly or disorderly features of these trajectories. On the contrary, entropic gravity works pretty well for the Newtonian view of gravity as a force, and not the GR view of gravity as a deformation of space time and analogous to acceleration. Acceleration is a very elementary concept, one you find even in microscopic descriptions. Gravity being essentially the same thing makes it far more elementary than a concept like entropy, which only applies to large groups of particles. So, if the GR picture is the right one, if gravity and acceleration are essentially the same thing, its very hard to see how that aligns with gravity being an emergent phenomenon that only happens at large scales. However, if gravity is just a tendency for massive objects to come together, as in the Newtonian picture, that is perfectly easy to imagine as an entropic effect. reply sixo 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This comment thread is exhibit N-thousand that &quot;nobody really understands entropy&quot;. My basic understanding goes like this: In thermodynamics, you describe a system with a massive number of microstates&#x2F;dynamical variable according to 2-3 measurable macrostate variables. (E.g. `N, V, E` for an ideal gas.) If you work out the dynamics of those macrostate variables, you will find that (to first order, i.e. in the thermodynamic limit) they depend only on the form of the entropy function of the system `S(E, N, V)`, e.g. Maxwell relations. If you measured a few more macrostate variables, e.g. the variance in energy `sigma^2(E)` and the center of mass `m`, or anything else, you would be able to write new dynamical relations that depend on a new &quot;entropy&quot; `S(E, N, V, sigma^2(E), m)`. You could add 1000 more variables, or a million—e.g every pixel of an image—basically up until the point where the thermodynamic limit assumptions cease to hold. The `S` function you&#x27;d get will capture the contribution of every-variable-you&#x27;re-marginalizing-over to the relationships between the remaining variables. This is the sense in which it represents &quot;imperfect knowledge&quot;. Entropy dependence arises mathematically in the relationships between macrostate variables—they can only couple to each by way of this function which summarizes all the variables you don&#x27;t know&#x2F;aren&#x27;t measuring&#x2F;aren&#x27;t specifying. That this works is rather surprising! It depends on some assumptions which I cannot remember (on convexity and factorizeabiltiy and things like that), but which apply to most or maybe all equilibrium thermodynamic-scale systems. For the ideal gas, say, the classical-mechanics, classical-probability, and quantum-mechanic descriptions of the system all reduce to the same `S(N, V, E)` function under this enormous marginalization—the most &quot;zoomed-out&quot; view of their underlying manifold structures turns out to be identical, which is why they all describe the same thing. (It is surprising that seemingly obvious things like the size of the particles would not matter. It turns out that the asymptotic dynamics depend only on the information theory of the available &quot;slots&quot; that energy can go into.) All of this appears as an artifact of the limiting procedure in the thermodynamic limit, but it may be the case that it&#x27;s more &quot;real&quot; than this—some hard-to-characterize quantum decoherence may lead to this being not only true in an extraordinarily sharp first-order limit, but actually physically true . I haven&#x27;t kept up with the field. No idea how to apply this to gravity though. reply IsTom 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] If you want to only have one possible past (i.e. can&#x27;t destroy information) then when you end up in one branch of quantum state you need to &quot;store&quot; enough information to separate you form other branches and you really do need to have multiple possible microstates to differentiate them. If you look post-factum obviously you did end up in a specific state, but statistics do their work otherwise. reply immibis 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] Entropy can be defined as the logarithm of the number of microstates in a macrostate. Since transition between microstates is reversible, and therefore one-to-one (can&#x27;t converge on any particular microstate, can&#x27;t go in cycles, have to be something like a random walk) we&#x27;re more likely to end up in a macrostate that holds a larger number of microstates. For example, there are many more ways your headphone cord can be tangled than untangled, so when you pull it out of your pocket, and it&#x27;s in a random state, then it&#x27;s very likely to be tangled. If entropy causes gravity, that means there are more somehow more microstates with all the mass in the universe smooshed together than microstates with all the mass in the universe spread apart. reply logicchains 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Entropy isn&#x27;t a function of imperfect knowledge.

Suppose you flip a coin. Before flipping the coin, your knowledge is &quot;heads or tails&quot;. After flipping it, your knowledge becomes one of either heads or tails. The amount of information you gained by resolving your imperfect knowledge is the entropy of the distribution. The same model works for physical entropy without much modification; the imperfect knowledge is the difference between knowing a macrostate versus the exact microstate. reply antonvs 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You’re glossing over an important point: your knowledge of the future state of the system is “heads or tails”. One of the things entropy tells us how a system is likely to evolve in future. But looking at this another way, entropy actually helps dictate how it will evolve in future. And we can prove that mathematically. reply kgwgk 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] p_i Edit to add lots of words: In the definition of entropy S := -k_B sum p_i ln (p_i) knowledge about the system enters the equation in the p_i terms. The other term is a constant so it’s not like there are many other choices to link the entropy to the system! reply mr_mitm 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Please communicate in full sentences with me. I can only guess that your objection is something about probabilities. A microstate has a probability independent of my knowledge of the system just like the probability of having a royal flush doesn&#x27;t change after drawing five cards. The probability of me ending the game with a royal flush might, but that is not what we mean by these probabilities. reply kgwgk 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The same microstate will have different probabilities depending on what are the constraints or measurements used in _your_ description of the system. If you choose to describe the system using its microstate - and you know it - there are no probabilities anywhere. You can of course know something and choose to ignore it - the entropy is still a reflection of the uncertainty (actual or for the sake of a lower-resolution model). reply tsimionescu 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] But the point is that, regardless of how you choose to describe or even measure the system, it will need exactly as much heat to raise its temperature by 1 degree (or it will need as much kinetic energy to increase the average velocity of the constituents by the same amount, in the microstate framework). So there is some objective nature to entropy, it&#x27;s not merely a function of subjective knowledge of a system. Or, to put it another way, two observers with different amounts of information on the microstate of a system will still measure it as having the same entropy. reply kgwgk 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There is some objective nature to the operational definition of entropy based on an experimental setup where you fix the volume and measure the temperature or whatever. And this is related to the statistical mechanical definition of entropy based on the value of the corresponding state variables. But it’s not a property of the microstate - it’s a property of the macrostate which makes sense only in the context of the experimental constraints and measurements. If we relate entropy to work that can be extracted someone with a better understanding of the state of the system and operational access to additional degrees of freedom can extract additional work. Thermodynamics assumes the state variables provide a complete description of the system. Statistical mechanics assumes the state variables provide an incomplete description of the system - and work out what that entails. reply tsimionescu 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; But it’s not a property of the microstate - it’s a property of the macrostate which makes sense only in the context of the experimental constraints and measurements. The same can be said about the wavefunction then, right? You can&#x27;t directly observe it, you can only use it to predict the statistics of a particular experimental setup. So, at worse, entropy is as real as wavefunction amplitudes. &gt; If we relate entropy to work that can be extracted someone with a better understanding of the state of the system and operational access to additional degrees of freedom can extract additional work. Is this actually true? Per my understanding, if I give you three containers, two of which are filled with some kind of gas that you know nothing about, and the third with a mix of those same gases, you can measure their entropy using thermodynamic experiments and tell which of the three is a mix of the other two because it will have a higher entropy. So, you can extract more work from one of the boxes despite not knowing anything more about it. reply kgwgk 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Per my understanding What’s the source of that understanding?

Note that there are many very widely used physical theories that include mathematical elements that are not necessarily assigned any physical meaning. The Poynting vector in classical electrodynamics, for example, carries no widely accepted physical meaning, even though it appears in many well verified and used calculations.

In quantum mechanics[1], this isn&#x27;t really a &quot;doesn&#x27;t exist&quot; kind of thing, rather it means that the wave function is there, leading to the (slim) possibility of existence through some kind of wave function collapse. What is proven is that e.g. vacuum energy &#x2F; zero point energy exists (not actually in the StarGate sense of extractable energy, just that the lowest energy state of any physical system isn&#x27;t zero), and that the Casimir effect exists. Vacuum energy directly leads to virtual particles through pair production (which is a proven mechanism, at high energies, for low energies we do suspect that there isn&#x27;t a cutoff there), and also influences e.g. high-energy cosmic rays leading to an observed high-energy cutoff (although there are other possible explanations for that cutoff and lack of very-high-energy cosmic rays). The Casimir effect is most easily explained by virtual particles and vaccum energy. In Hawking radiation, the idea is actually that virtual particles through interaction with the gravity of the black hole become real particles. The event horizon actually makes those wave functions collapse such that real particles start to exist. Hawking radiation hasn&#x27;t been observed yet, however.

If theres more &quot;space&quot; (imagining more space coordinates possible) for me on the left than on the right, me jumping to a random location would statistically move me left. Repeating results in movement, getting closer to the object intensifies this effect, results in acceleration.

Entropy is a dispersive force — it favors distribution and disorder. But the universe clumps. Planets, stars, galaxies — all of them are low-entropy configurations. So how did scattered dust particles form the planet we’re standing on… through entropy? If gravity is just emergent from entropy, then it should be fighting against planet formation, not causing it.

This is what I like to refer to as “imagination”, and it’s a great way to start thinking about problems. The fact that it’s showing up in an article suggests they didn’t get much further than imagination, but I’ll keep reading… &gt; “But it’s randomly interacting with masses in some way, such that on average you see all the normal gravity things that you know about: The Earth orbits the sun, and so forth.” &gt; Cool. We’re back on everything being “random” again. Modern interpretations of quantum mechanics has really torn a hole in the idea of causality by replacing it with the idea that we can’t explain why things happen, but we CAN model it statistically, so we’ll assume the model is right and stop looking for causal relationships entirely.” It’s lazy pessimistic psuedo-science, and I don’t buy it. I don’t outright REFUTE it, but I’m not basing my understanding of nature on it just because a bunch of smart people decided to stop looking. On the paper the article refers to: &gt; Consider a pair of massive pistons with a non-interacting gas between them, as in Fig. 1. &gt; Cool. Happy to consider it. But I am curious… Are there existing examples of particles that do not interact with particles of like kind? Neutrinos and Photons come to mind. But has anyone proven that they don’t interact, or are we just assuming they don’t interact because we haven’t put the effort in to try and detect interactions? But sure, let’s consider the possibility. &gt; What this exercise demonstrates is that the two pistons feel an effective force between them, namely the pressure, which is mediated by the gas rather than some fundamental quantized field. &gt; Honestly? I love this. I don’t care about “fields” at all, personally. I feel like it’s more intuitive to think of fields as reinforcement of particle interactions over time and space. An electon moves? So do all of the others. A lot of them move the same way? The others feel that combined movement at distance according to C. Magnetic flux? Interplay of electron inertia reinforcment delayed by the time it takes for the repulsive forces to make their way around a coil (or whatever other medium according to it’s influence) and allow spin to align. Falsifiable? Yes. Relevant intuitive observation? Yes. Taken the time to write out the math myself in languages I don’t know? No. &gt; &lt;… lot’s of math that proves individual hypothetical (sorry, theoretical) particle interactions can explain how gravity emerges…&gt; &gt; Cool. I’m almost certain that if I took the time to check their math, it would be meaningfully accurate and absolutely show that this is a way you can view gravity. But let me ask you… Why the hell would anyone want to think about gravity like that, and why are we trying to explain things in terms of entropy when it clearly has no applications outside of “well, I guess everything is left up to chance, and there’s nothing left to be discovered.” I reject this hypothesis. I reject the idea that everything we see, feel, hear, and know was at one point non-existant, and somehow emerged at this level of complexity such that we are capable of not only cognition but also direct observation of physical phenomena while simultaneously being physical phenomena ourselves. There is something else. And no, it’s not “God”. But it sure as hell isn’t “everything’s just falling apart in interesting ways”. And I get that that’s not the “full idea” behind entropy, but it is entropy’s brand identity, and it is the implication behind entropy as the driving force of nature (sorry, I used force again. I forget we&#x27;re not allowed to say that about the thing we&#x27;re using to explain how all of the real forces emerge. my bad). Heat death of the universe as a result of entropy? I’m onboard. Red shift? I get it. Entropy is a great “welp I guess that’s the reason again”, but the mental gymnastics it takes to represent gravity as a result of this? Give me a freaking break. There’s a simpler explanation for all of this that models well across domains, and nobody is willing to admit it because it doesn’t fit the narrative. Phase-lock. Waveforms that mesh together in torsional space time reinforce each other, sometimes purely locally through identity changes (fusion), and sometimes via interdependant standing waves (non-fundamental particles, atoms, molecules, etc etc). Entropy is just what happens when coherence fails to resolve locally and must resolve non-locally (chemical interactions, fission, dielectric breakdown, photoelectric effect). Most things can be modelled this way: as stable geometric configurations of quantum wave functions representing self-reinforcing torsional spacetime harmonics. And if you take a second to consider it, maybe this single paragraph _is_ a more intuitive explanation of gravity, too. reply ajkjk 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] There is a whole article explaining it... if you don&#x27;t read the article, how do you expect to know the idea? reply cantor_S_drug 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Actually Roger Penrose also had this line of thinking if my memory serves right. reply cryptonector 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] You have it backwards. The lowest entropy state of the universe would be if there were no attractive forces, only repellent forces, as then all particles would be forced into something of an expanding lattice, but with all particles equidistant from all nearest neighbors (of the same type). It is gravity which disrupts this and causes clumping, and that _increases_ entropy. I know it&#x27;s confusing because normally one would think of a cloud of gas as more disordered than the star it might collapse into, but that is not so. For one the star would be much hotter, and the motions of every particle in the star much more chaotic. reply konschubert 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This is not a philosophical discussion reply cwharris 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This paper is literally physical philosophy.

Mass is composed of these particles that are bound by C. Because they are vibrating, a lot of that speed is being wasted in brownian motion. So the denser it is, the more your average vector is going to be toward more dense brownian motion as the particles interact and induce more brownian motion. The gradient has a natural sorting effect. Seems pretty intuitive to me. The question remains though, what is this density made of since gravity exists in a vacuum?

Long-shot idea gets another look | Hacker News Hacker News new | past | comments | ask | show | jobs | submit login Is gravity just entropy rising? Long-shot idea gets another look ( quantamagazine.org ) 223 points by pseudolus 19 hours ago | hide | past | favorite | 198&nbsp;comments abetusk 4 hours ago | next [–] Entropic gravity is like the &quot;brazil nut effect&quot; [0] [1]. The idea is that if you shake a glass full of different sized nuts, the large ones will rise to the top. From what I understand, this is because larger objects have more mass, moving slower when shaked, so as the larger (brazil nuts) don&#x27;t move as much relative to the smaller ones (peanuts), and because of gravity, there&#x27;s a cavity left under the brazil nut which gets filled in with peanuts. For entropic gravity, the idea is that there&#x27;s a base density of something (particles? sub-atomic particles?) hitting objects in random ways from all directions. When two large massive objects get near each other, their middle region will have lower density thus being attracted to each other from particles hit with less frequency from the lower density region. They sort of cast a &quot;shadow&quot;. I&#x27;m no physicist but last time I looked into it there were assumptions about the density of whatever particle was &quot;hitting&quot; larger massive objects and that density was hard to justify. Would love to hear about someone more knowledgeable than myself that can correct or enlighten me. As an aside, the brazil nut effect is a very real effect. To get the raisins, you shake the raisin bran. To get gifts left from your cat, you shake the kitty litter. It works surprisingly well.

It is interesting to consider one of these, which many people have thought of from time to time. At first, one is quite excited and happy when he “discovers” it, but he soon finds that it is not correct. It was first discovered about 1750. Suppose there were many particles moving in space at a very high speed in all directions and being only slightly absorbed in going through matter. When they are absorbed, they give an impulse to the earth. However, since there are as many going one way as another, the impulses all balance. But when the sun is nearby, the particles coming toward the earth through the sun are partially absorbed, so fewer of them are coming from the sun than are coming from the other side. Therefore, the earth feels a net impulse toward the sun and it does not take one long to see that it is inversely as the square of the distance—because of the variation of the solid angle that the sun subtends as we vary the distance. What is wrong with that machinery? It involves some new consequences which are not true. This particular idea has the following trouble: the earth, in moving around the sun, would impinge on more particles which are coming from its forward side than from its hind side (when you run in the rain, the rain in your face is stronger than that on the back of your head!). Therefore there would be more impulse given the earth from the front, and the earth would feel a resistance to motion and would be slowing up in its orbit. One can calculate how long it would take for the earth to stop as a result of this resistance, and it would not take long enough for the earth to still be in its orbit, so this mechanism does not work. No machinery has ever been invented that “explains” gravity without also predicting some other phenomenon that does not exist.&quot; reply AnotherGoodName 52 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] It also doesn&#x27;t account for time dilation in a gravity well however i still think the general idea has some merit if you think of it as being bombarded by massless ‘action potentials’ on all sides with mass absorbing that field to some to enable translation in space time. I get this is vague spitballing but essentially an ‘action potential’ would allow mass to move. Higher temperature mass interacts more, lower temperature interacts less. Mass with momentum would be biased to absorb more from one side so it travels in a specific direction in space more than others (the idea i’m getting at is that all movement in space only occurs with interaction with this field), this also would counteract issues with moving mass interacting more on a specific side - the very bias of mass with momentum to absorb more on one side means that from that masses point of view it has the same action potentials interacting from all sides. Mass shielded behind mass receives fewer action potentials so experiences exactly the effect that you can call time dilation. Mass shielding other mass from action potentials also means that mass accelerates towards other mass. Essentially its the above but instead of a massive particle hitting other mass from all sides it’s a field that allows mass to experience a unit of time. reply FilosofumRex 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This is a better YouTube video describing granular physics and shows the speed (amplitude) of vibrations can cause counterintuitive arrangements of particles.

I&#x27;ll have to check out the paper but just watching the video it seems all these counter intuitive effects can be described from the oscillations being related to the size of the chamber. For example if I were to roll the chamber at a very low frequency, I would expect the particles to clump on one side, then the other and so on. This is not really so surprising and the frequency will depend on the chamber dimensions. reply Someone 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; From what I understand, this is because larger objects have more mass, moving slower when shaked, so as the larger (brazil nuts) don&#x27;t move as much relative to the smaller ones (peanuts) That doesn’t make sense to me. If larger objects move slower, don’t they move faster relative to the (accelerating) reference frame of the container? Also, conventional wisdom has it that shaking (temporarily) creates empty spaces, and smaller objects ‘need’ smaller such spaces to fall down, and thus are more likely to fall down into such a space. reply ndriscoll 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Aren&#x27;t more massive particles smaller though (in terms of de Broglie wavelength, at least), so they&#x27;d have a smaller &quot;shadow&quot;? Or do different forces have different cross-sections with different relationships to mass, so a particle&#x27;s &quot;size&quot; is different for different interactions (and could be proportional to mass for gravity)? Actually this is currently blowing my mind: does the (usual intro QM) wavefunction only describe the probability amplitude for the position of a particle when using photon interaction to measure , and actually a particle&#x27;s &quot;position&quot; would be different if we used e.g. interaction with a Z boson to define &quot;position measurement&quot;? reply bobbylarrybobby 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The momentum wavefunction (or more properly, the wavefunction in the momentum basis) completely determines the position wavefunction (wavefunction in the position basis). And we can probe the momentum wavefunction with any particle at all, by setting up identical (say) electrons and seeing the momentum they impart on a variety of test particles. That is to say, the probability distribution of momentum of a particle does not depend on what we use to probe it. As the position wavefunction is now completely determined in a probe-agnostic matter, it would be hard to justify calling a probe that didn&#x27;t yield the corresponding probability distribution a “position measurement”. reply hcarvalhoalves 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] In other words, gravity would be explainable by statistical mechanics (like heat)? reply abetusk 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] That&#x27;s the allure, that gravity is a derived effect from statistical mechanics.

To me, entropy is not a physical thing, but a measure of our imperfect knowledge about a system. We can only measure the bulk properties of matter, so we&#x27;ve made up a number to quantify how imperfect the bulk properties describe the true microscopic state of the system. But if we had the ability to zoom into the microscopic level, entropy would make no sense. So I don&#x27;t see how gravity or any other fundamental physical interaction could follow from entropy.

You can equally well apply your argument that it isn’t a physical thing because it doesn’t exist on a microscopic scale to temperature. Temperature doesn’t exist when you zoom in on single particles either. There’s no reason to involve our knowledge of the system.

Simple example: why ice melts in a warm room. More subtle example: why cords get tangled up over time. Our measures of entropy can be seen as a way of summarizing, at a macro level, the state of a system such as that warm room containing ice, or a tangle of cables, but the measure is not the same thing as the phenomenon it describes. Boltzmann&#x27;s approach to entropy makes the second law pretty intuitive: there are far more ways for a system to be disordered than ordered, so over time it tends towards higher entropy. That’s why ice melts in a warm room. reply aeonik 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] My take, for what it&#x27;s worth, Entropy isn’t always the driver of physical change, sometimes it’s just a map. Sometimes that map is highly isomorphic to the physical process, like in gas diffusion or smoke dispersion. In those cases, entropy doesn&#x27;t just describe what happened, it predicts it. The microstates and the probabilities align tightly with what’s physically unfolding. Entropy is the engine. But other times, like when ice melts, entropy is a summary , not a cause. The real drivers are bond energies and phase thresholds. Entropy increases, yes, but only because the system overcame physical constraints that entropy alone can’t explain. In this case, entropy is the receipt, not the mechanism. So the key idea is this: entropy’s usefulness depends on how well it “sees” the real degrees of freedom that matter. When it aligns closely with the substrate, it feels like a law. When it doesn&#x27;t, it’s more like coarse bookkeeping after the fact. The second law of thermodynamics is most “real” when entropy is the process. Otherwise, it’s a statistical summary of deeper physical causes. reply lumost 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] What makes entropy interesting is that you can describe many physical processes through analysis of the systems degrees of freedom. This pattern repeats regularly despite the systems being radically different. So you can interpret entropy as being about as real as potential energy or newtons laws.

How do you even define entropy for a system of 2 particles? The answer is that this doesn&#x27;t happen in a system with only 2 particles. The idea of gravity as an entropic phenomenon is that you introduce some other kind of particle that permeates spacetime, so there is no system that only contains 2 particles. You may use some idea like virtual particles from quantum field theory, or you may define &quot;quanta of space time&quot; as something that is not technically a particle but basically works like one in a handwavy sense. But the basic point of these entropy based theories is to explain gravity, and typcilaly spacetime itself, as an emergent result of a collection of numerous objects of some kind. This necessarily means that they don&#x27;t make sense if applied to idealized systems with very few objects - which is why they typically posit such isolated systems simply can&#x27;t actually exist in reality. reply ccozan 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Let me try to answer. Let&#x27;s say the particles are experiencing gravity as a natural entropy phenomena. They will attract until they become so close that they are now seen as a single particle. The new system has a lower entropy and a higher gravity than before. Explanation seems very rudimentary but that is the gist of the theory. From my point of view, I might add the layer of information density. Every quantum fluctuation is an event and the more particles the more information is produced in a defined space volume.

There is some tension between those claims. The latter seems to support the parent comment’s remark questioning whether a “fundamental physical interaction could follow from entropy”. It seems more appropriate to say that entropy follows from the physical interaction - not to be confused with the measure used to describe it. One may say that pressure is an entropic force and physical entropy governs the real physical process of gas expanding within a piston. However, one may also say that it’s the kinetic energy of the gas molecules what governs the physical process - which arguably is a more fundamental and satisfactory explanation. reply willvarfar 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The way we use the word &#x27;entropy&#x27; in computer science is different from how its used in physics.

You are absolutely right that entropy is always fundamentally a way to describe are our lack of perfect knowledge of the system [0]. Nevertheless there is a distinct &quot;reality&quot; to entropic forces, in the sense that it is something that can actually be measured in the lab. If you are not convinced then you can look at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Entropic_force and in particular the example that is always used in a first class on this topic: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ideal_chain So when viewed in this way entropy is not just a &quot;made-up thing&quot;, but an effective way to describe observed phenomena. That makes it useful for effective but not fundamental laws of physics. And indeed the wiki page says that entropic forces are an &quot;emergent phenomenon&quot;. Therefore, any reasonable person believing in entropic gravity will automatically call gravity an emergent phenomenon. They must conclude that there is a new, fundamental theory of gravity to be found, and this theory will &quot;restore&quot; the probabilistic interpretation of entropy. The reason entropic gravity is exciting and exotic is that many other searches for this fundamental theory start with a (more or less) direct quantization of gravity, much like one can quantize classical mechanics to arrive at quantum mechanics. Entropic gravity posits that this is the wrong approach, in the same way that one does not try to directly quantize the ideal gas law.

Anyone claiming otherwise is stuck in the nineteenth century, perhaps because they learned only thermodynamics but not statistical mechanics. reply meindnoch 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Sure, I&#x27;m not denying that entropy exists as a concept, that can be used to explain things macroscopically. But like you said, it&#x27;s origins are statistical. To me, temperature is also a similar &quot;made up&quot; concept. We can only talk about temperature, because a sufficiently large group of particles will converge to a single-parameter distribution with their velocities. A single particle in isolation doesn&#x27;t have a temperature. So if they say gravity might be an entropic effect, does that mean that they assume there&#x27;s something more fundamental &quot;underneath&quot; spacetime that - in the statistical limit - produces the emergent phenomenon of gravity? So it isn&#x27;t the entropy of matter that they talk about, but the entropy of something else, like the grains of spacetime of whatever. reply flufluflufluffy 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, exactly. The model is based on (in the first approach) a “lattice” of some type of undiscovered particle-like thing (what they refer to as “qubits” in the article, which is unfortunate because it is NOT the same “qubit” from quantum computing) permeating space time. Or maybe more aptly, it is that lattice from which spacetime emerges.

The second item doesn&#x27;t entail the first. Probabilities can be seen as a measure of lack of knowledge about a system, but it isn&#x27;t necessarily so. A phenomenon can also be inherently&#x2F;fundamentally probabilistic. For example, wave function collapse is, to the best of our knowledge, an inherently non-deterministic process. This is very relevant to questions about the nature of entropy - especially since we have yet to determine if it&#x27;s even possible for a large system to be in a non-collapsed state. If it turns out that there is some fundamental process that causes wave function collapse even in perfectly isolated quantum systems, then it would be quite likely that entropy is related to such a process, and that it may be more than a measure of our lack of knowledge about the internal state of a system, and instead a measurement of the objective &quot;definiteness&quot; of that state. I am aware that objective collapse theories are both unpopular and have some significant hurdles to overcome - but I also think that from a practical perspective, the gap between the largest systems we have been able to observe in pure states versus the smallest systems we could consider measurement devices is still gigantic and leaves us quite a lot of room for speculation. reply mjburgess 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Even if we take that view, gravity is still basically a similar case. What we call &quot;gravity&quot; is really an apparent force, that isnt a force at all when seen from a full 4d pov. Imagine sitting outside the whole universe from t=0,t=end and observing one whole block. Then the trajectories of matter, unaffected by any force at all, are those we call gravitational. From this pov, it makes a lot more sense to connect gravity with some orderly or disorderly features of these trajectories. Inertia, on this view, is just a kind of hysteresis the matter distribution of the universe has -- ie., a kind of remembered deformation that persists as the universe evolves. reply tsimionescu 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; From this pov, it makes a lot more sense to connect gravity with some orderly or disorderly features of these trajectories. On the contrary, entropic gravity works pretty well for the Newtonian view of gravity as a force, and not the GR view of gravity as a deformation of space time and analogous to acceleration. Acceleration is a very elementary concept, one you find even in microscopic descriptions. Gravity being essentially the same thing makes it far more elementary than a concept like entropy, which only applies to large groups of particles. So, if the GR picture is the right one, if gravity and acceleration are essentially the same thing, its very hard to see how that aligns with gravity being an emergent phenomenon that only happens at large scales. However, if gravity is just a tendency for massive objects to come together, as in the Newtonian picture, that is perfectly easy to imagine as an entropic effect. reply sixo 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This comment thread is exhibit N-thousand that &quot;nobody really understands entropy&quot;. My basic understanding goes like this: In thermodynamics, you describe a system with a massive number of microstates&#x2F;dynamical variable according to 2-3 measurable macrostate variables. (E.g. `N, V, E` for an ideal gas.) If you work out the dynamics of those macrostate variables, you will find that (to first order, i.e. in the thermodynamic limit) they depend only on the form of the entropy function of the system `S(E, N, V)`, e.g. Maxwell relations. If you measured a few more macrostate variables, e.g. the variance in energy `sigma^2(E)` and the center of mass `m`, or anything else, you would be able to write new dynamical relations that depend on a new &quot;entropy&quot; `S(E, N, V, sigma^2(E), m)`. You could add 1000 more variables, or a million—e.g every pixel of an image—basically up until the point where the thermodynamic limit assumptions cease to hold. The `S` function you&#x27;d get will capture the contribution of every-variable-you&#x27;re-marginalizing-over to the relationships between the remaining variables. This is the sense in which it represents &quot;imperfect knowledge&quot;. Entropy dependence arises mathematically in the relationships between macrostate variables—they can only couple to each by way of this function which summarizes all the variables you don&#x27;t know&#x2F;aren&#x27;t measuring&#x2F;aren&#x27;t specifying. That this works is rather surprising! It depends on some assumptions which I cannot remember (on convexity and factorizeabiltiy and things like that), but which apply to most or maybe all equilibrium thermodynamic-scale systems. For the ideal gas, say, the classical-mechanics, classical-probability, and quantum-mechanic descriptions of the system all reduce to the same `S(N, V, E)` function under this enormous marginalization—the most &quot;zoomed-out&quot; view of their underlying manifold structures turns out to be identical, which is why they all describe the same thing. (It is surprising that seemingly obvious things like the size of the particles would not matter. It turns out that the asymptotic dynamics depend only on the information theory of the available &quot;slots&quot; that energy can go into.) All of this appears as an artifact of the limiting procedure in the thermodynamic limit, but it may be the case that it&#x27;s more &quot;real&quot; than this—some hard-to-characterize quantum decoherence may lead to this being not only true in an extraordinarily sharp first-order limit, but actually physically true . I haven&#x27;t kept up with the field.

If you look post-factum obviously you did end up in a specific state, but statistics do their work otherwise. reply immibis 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] Entropy can be defined as the logarithm of the number of microstates in a macrostate. Since transition between microstates is reversible, and therefore one-to-one (can&#x27;t converge on any particular microstate, can&#x27;t go in cycles, have to be something like a random walk) we&#x27;re more likely to end up in a macrostate that holds a larger number of microstates. For example, there are many more ways your headphone cord can be tangled than untangled, so when you pull it out of your pocket, and it&#x27;s in a random state, then it&#x27;s very likely to be tangled.

I know very little about physics but I thought that the leading interpretations of quantum physics say that the probability distribution is all we can know about a system.

Knowledge about a system never enters the equation. S := -k_B sum p_i ln (p_i) reply ajkjk 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] As the other replier said, despite your dismissiveness, the knowledge about the system is in the probabilities, so it&#x27;s right there in the equation. Suppose you flip a coin. Before flipping the coin, your knowledge is &quot;heads or tails&quot;. After flipping it, your knowledge becomes one of either heads or tails. The amount of information you gained by resolving your imperfect knowledge is the entropy of the distribution. The same model works for physical entropy without much modification; the imperfect knowledge is the difference between knowing a macrostate versus the exact microstate. reply antonvs 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You’re glossing over an important point: your knowledge of the future state of the system is “heads or tails”. One of the things entropy tells us how a system is likely to evolve in future. But looking at this another way, entropy actually helps dictate how it will evolve in future. And we can prove that mathematically. reply kgwgk 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] p_i Edit to add lots of words: In the definition of entropy S := -k_B sum p_i ln (p_i) knowledge about the system enters the equation in the p_i terms. The other term is a constant so it’s not like there are many other choices to link the entropy to the system! reply mr_mitm 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Please communicate in full sentences with me. I can only guess that your objection is something about probabilities. A microstate has a probability independent of my knowledge of the system just like the probability of having a royal flush doesn&#x27;t change after drawing five cards. The probability of me ending the game with a royal flush might, but that is not what we mean by these probabilities. reply kgwgk 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The same microstate will have different probabilities depending on what are the constraints or measurements used in _your_ description of the system. If you choose to describe the system using its microstate - and you know it - there are no probabilities anywhere. You can of course know something and choose to ignore it - the entropy is still a reflection of the uncertainty (actual or for the sake of a lower-resolution model). reply tsimionescu 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] But the point is that, regardless of how you choose to describe or even measure the system, it will need exactly as much heat to raise its temperature by 1 degree (or it will need as much kinetic energy to increase the average velocity of the constituents by the same amount, in the microstate framework). So there is some objective nature to entropy, it&#x27;s not merely a function of subjective knowledge of a system. Or, to put it another way, two observers with different amounts of information on the microstate of a system will still measure it as having the same entropy. reply kgwgk 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There is some objective nature to the operational definition of entropy based on an experimental setup where you fix the volume and measure the temperature or whatever. And this is related to the statistical mechanical definition of entropy based on the value of the corresponding state variables. But it’s not a property of the microstate - it’s a property of the macrostate which makes sense only in the context of the experimental constraints and measurements. If we relate entropy to work that can be extracted someone with a better understanding of the state of the system and operational access to additional degrees of freedom can extract additional work. Thermodynamics assumes the state variables provide a complete description of the system. Statistical mechanics assumes the state variables provide an incomplete description of the system - and work out what that entails. reply tsimionescu 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; But it’s not a property of the microstate - it’s a property of the macrostate which makes sense only in the context of the experimental constraints and measurements. The same can be said about the wavefunction then, right? You can&#x27;t directly observe it, you can only use it to predict the statistics of a particular experimental setup. So, at worse, entropy is as real as wavefunction amplitudes. &gt; If we relate entropy to work that can be extracted someone with a better understanding of the state of the system and operational access to additional degrees of freedom can extract additional work. Is this actually true? Per my understanding, if I give you three containers, two of which are filled with some kind of gas that you know nothing about, and the third with a mix of those same gases, you can measure their entropy using thermodynamic experiments and tell which of the three is a mix of the other two because it will have a higher entropy. So, you can extract more work from one of the boxes despite not knowing anything more about it. reply kgwgk 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Per my understanding What’s the source of that understanding?

Any finite-size system or any system with some kind of influence&#x2F;force&#x2F;anything will have a lowest energy state that is not actually zero energy but slightly above.

It&#x27;s in fact considered impossible to verify experimentally, even in principle. Note that there are many very widely used physical theories that include mathematical elements that are not necessarily assigned any physical meaning. The Poynting vector in classical electrodynamics, for example, carries no widely accepted physical meaning, even though it appears in many well verified and used calculations. This doesn&#x27;t make the theory suspect or anything, I&#x27;m not trying to imply that - simply that virtual particles being &quot;real&quot; or not is a mostly philosophical question that has no widely accepted consensus. reply holowoodman 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Those particles are virtual in that they don&#x27;t really exist, so you are right that proving them isn&#x27;t actually possible, because they are simply not there, just virtually, in our mathematical imagination. In quantum mechanics[1], this isn&#x27;t really a &quot;doesn&#x27;t exist&quot; kind of thing, rather it means that the wave function is there, leading to the (slim) possibility of existence through some kind of wave function collapse. What is proven is that e.g. vacuum energy &#x2F; zero point energy exists (not actually in the StarGate sense of extractable energy, just that the lowest energy state of any physical system isn&#x27;t zero), and that the Casimir effect exists. Vacuum energy directly leads to virtual particles through pair production (which is a proven mechanism, at high energies, for low energies we do suspect that there isn&#x27;t a cutoff there), and also influences e.g. high-energy cosmic rays leading to an observed high-energy cutoff (although there are other possible explanations for that cutoff and lack of very-high-energy cosmic rays). The Casimir effect is most easily explained by virtual particles and vaccum energy. In Hawking radiation, the idea is actually that virtual particles through interaction with the gravity of the black hole become real particles. The event horizon actually makes those wave functions collapse such that real particles start to exist. Hawking radiation hasn&#x27;t been observed yet, however.

OTOH de Broglie for one of the central ideas in the development of quantum mechanics: he inverted Einstein&#x27;s idea about photons, which were previously thought to be waves but Einstein showed how they came in particle-like quanta. de Broglie realised you could apply the same thinking to matter, which had previously been thought of as particles, and describe them using waves.

Saw enough progress there to convince myself it&#x27;s possible, but wasn&#x27;t happy with the current HV supplies on the market, so I&#x27;m working on making my own based on converting compressed argon in to a high voltage source that self-regulates based on plasma generation in an attempt to not exceed metastable argon charge levels, which would produce NOx and Ozone at completely harmless levels (unless maybe you&#x27;re using it during surgery) but are heavily regulated. It&#x27;s uhh... been a ride. But yes, posting to hacker news is a new thing. Because I&#x27;m seeing the limitations of the world we live in through the lens of someone who&#x27;s gone through industry long enough to know how slowly controlled progress is, and beginning to see what happens when you apply semiconductors to more than just microprocessors on your own terms. The world is stagnating, not because we don&#x27;t have what it takes to bring about the future... but because 1) we do, 2) the people in control don&#x27;t care to make it happen, and 3) everyone has their hands tied up in corperate profits while we wait for someone to make a move that makes things better. I&#x27;m just... done waiting. reply bee_rider 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] We’ve definitely reached that point.

I&#x27;m typing this with Google Keyboard right now. If you hold the hyphen button, you get options for an underscore, an em dash (—) an en dash (–), and the dot symbol (·). The ellipsis (…) can be written by holding the period button. But yeah, the commenter admitted it was authored by AI. But even if you converted all the em dashes to &quot;--&quot;, it would still have a ChatGPT cadence. &gt; There’s a missing piece here — maybe coherence, resonance, or field attraction. But “just entropy”? That doesn’t explain formation. It explains dissolution. Even ignoring the em dash, it just screams ChatGPT. reply cwharris 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I like how people are recognizing &quot;OH THIS IS TOKEN OUTPUT&quot;, and that&#x27;s like... the only thing you can come up with to refute the argument? Like not the actual content or meaning of the text, which I chose to post, but the mere fact that it wasn&#x27;t typed in to a keyboard directly in a hacker news text box, but rather pasted after using a tool to refine the verbiage. Honestly? Great test for most posts. We live in a world surrounded by people who are just copy and pasting ChatGPT answers like a magic 8 ball, and I respect your instinct to try to avoid those. But that&#x27;s not how I use ChatGPT, because I understand how language models work and choose to use them intentionally to help me nagivate ideas and learn new concepts (as well as write memos after-the-fact).

This is what I like to refer to as “imagination”, and it’s a great way to start thinking about problems. The fact that it’s showing up in an article suggests they didn’t get much further than imagination, but I’ll keep reading… &gt; “But it’s randomly interacting with masses in some way, such that on average you see all the normal gravity things that you know about: The Earth orbits the sun, and so forth.” &gt; Cool. We’re back on everything being “random” again. Modern interpretations of quantum mechanics has really torn a hole in the idea of causality by replacing it with the idea that we can’t explain why things happen, but we CAN model it statistically, so we’ll assume the model is right and stop looking for causal relationships entirely.” It’s lazy pessimistic psuedo-science, and I don’t buy it. I don’t outright REFUTE it, but I’m not basing my understanding of nature on it just because a bunch of smart people decided to stop looking. On the paper the article refers to: &gt; Consider a pair of massive pistons with a non-interacting gas between them, as in Fig. 1. &gt; Cool. Happy to consider it. But I am curious… Are there existing examples of particles that do not interact with particles of like kind? Neutrinos and Photons come to mind. But has anyone proven that they don’t interact, or are we just assuming they don’t interact because we haven’t put the effort in to try and detect interactions? But sure, let’s consider the possibility. &gt; What this exercise demonstrates is that the two pistons feel an effective force between them, namely the pressure, which is mediated by the gas rather than some fundamental quantized field. &gt; Honestly? I love this. I don’t care about “fields” at all, personally. I feel like it’s more intuitive to think of fields as reinforcement of particle interactions over time and space. An electon moves? So do all of the others. A lot of them move the same way? The others feel that combined movement at distance according to C. Magnetic flux? Interplay of electron inertia reinforcment delayed by the time it takes for the repulsive forces to make their way around a coil (or whatever other medium according to it’s influence) and allow spin to align. Falsifiable? Yes. Relevant intuitive observation? Yes. Taken the time to write out the math myself in languages I don’t know? No. &gt; &lt;… lot’s of math that proves individual hypothetical (sorry, theoretical) particle interactions can explain how gravity emerges…&gt; &gt; Cool. I’m almost certain that if I took the time to check their math, it would be meaningfully accurate and absolutely show that this is a way you can view gravity. But let me ask you… Why the hell would anyone want to think about gravity like that, and why are we trying to explain things in terms of entropy when it clearly has no applications outside of “well, I guess everything is left up to chance, and there’s nothing left to be discovered.” I reject this hypothesis. I reject the idea that everything we see, feel, hear, and know was at one point non-existant, and somehow emerged at this level of complexity such that we are capable of not only cognition but also direct observation of physical phenomena while simultaneously being physical phenomena ourselves. There is something else. And no, it’s not “God”. But it sure as hell isn’t “everything’s just falling apart in interesting ways”. And I get that that’s not the “full idea” behind entropy, but it is entropy’s brand identity, and it is the implication behind entropy as the driving force of nature (sorry, I used force again. I forget we&#x27;re not allowed to say that about the thing we&#x27;re using to explain how all of the real forces emerge. my bad). Heat death of the universe as a result of entropy? I’m onboard. Red shift? I get it. Entropy is a great “welp I guess that’s the reason again”, but the mental gymnastics it takes to represent gravity as a result of this? Give me a freaking break. There’s a simpler explanation for all of this that models well across domains, and nobody is willing to admit it because it doesn’t fit the narrative. Phase-lock. Waveforms that mesh together in torsional space time reinforce each other, sometimes purely locally through identity changes (fusion), and sometimes via interdependant standing waves (non-fundamental particles, atoms, molecules, etc etc). Entropy is just what happens when coherence fails to resolve locally and must resolve non-locally (chemical interactions, fission, dielectric breakdown, photoelectric effect). Most things can be modelled this way: as stable geometric configurations of quantum wave functions representing self-reinforcing torsional spacetime harmonics. And if you take a second to consider it, maybe this single paragraph _is_ a more intuitive explanation of gravity, too. reply ajkjk 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] There is a whole article explaining it... if you don&#x27;t read the article, how do you expect to know the idea? reply cantor_S_drug 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Actually Roger Penrose also had this line of thinking if my memory serves right. reply cryptonector 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] You have it backwards. The lowest entropy state of the universe would be if there were no attractive forces, only repellent forces, as then all particles would be forced into something of an expanding lattice, but with all particles equidistant from all nearest neighbors (of the same type). It is gravity which disrupts this and causes clumping, and that _increases_ entropy. I know it&#x27;s confusing because normally one would think of a cloud of gas as more disordered than the star it might collapse into, but that is not so. For one the star would be much hotter, and the motions of every particle in the star much more chaotic. reply konschubert 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This is not a philosophical discussion reply cwharris 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This paper is literally physical philosophy. To be science, it would require recursive experimentation, observation, and adjustment to hypothesis, until the model it proposes becomes a stable, reliable, and (most importantly) useful interpretation. It does none of that, and so I have no responsibility to do so prior to discussing it. reply neuroelectron 6 hours ago | prev [–] The speed of light is C, a constant. Mass is composed of these particles that are bound by C. Because they are vibrating, a lot of that speed is being wasted in brownian motion. So the denser it is, the more your average vector is going to be toward more dense brownian motion as the particles interact and induce more brownian motion. The gradient has a natural sorting effect. Seems pretty intuitive to me. The question remains though, what is this density made of since gravity exists in a vacuum? Quantum fluctuations popping in and out of reality? Does this infer that quantum fluctuations are affected by mass as well? It would seem so since in Bose Einstein Condensate, what is &quot;communicating&quot; the state across the BEC if the particles are no longer interacting? reply steamrolled 6 hours ago | parent | next [–] &gt; Because they are vibrating, a lot of that energy is being wasted in brownian motion.

Apart from whatever-you&#x27;re-talking-about-with-C, quantum fluctuations are not Brownian motion; Brownian motion is the visible effect of a lot of invisible particles interacting kinetically with macroscopic particles like dust, making those macroscopic particles appear to vibrate of their own accord. Atoms that cannot be seen in a microscope flying around in straight lines and randomly bumping into dust particles that can be seen. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brownian_motion reply ajkjk 6 hours ago | parent | prev [–] Doesn&#x27;t sound intuitive at all really... reply neuroelectron 6 hours ago | root | parent [–] You can see it in action with a simple random walk program.

In our discussions, we agreed that continuity of the product was in the best interest of the users and the community (and of both founders and investors, who do not enjoy being blamed for shutting down tools they can no longer afford to run), and we agreed that this could best be achieved by selling it to the employees. Any other examples of that? I&#x27;m particularly interested in that for this kind of software product. reply eddythompson80 20 minutes ago | parent | next [–] &gt; Any other examples of that? I&#x27;m particularly interested in that for this kind of software product. As far as I know, this pattern is not uncommon among traditional businesses. King Arthur Flour Company is the largest one that comes to my mind, but on a local level; grocery stores, restaurants, mechanic shops, plumbing businesses, etc very often &quot;change ownership&quot; this way. In software, it&#x27;s pretty common in informal OSS project to transition ownership this way when the original owner&#x2F;author loses interest or is otherwise unable to maintain the project.

Only if they are buying it for what the investors had already put into it, which is not likely. They most likely discussed how much the investors values physical assets and trademarks the company holds (like how much they are likely to get back in a bankruptcy) plus whatever makes a deal fair and maintain a happy cordial relationship with said investors for future endeavors. reply qwertox 36 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] I wish the owners of Komoot would have done this. They sold the company because they didn&#x27;t see a future of growth, and the employees were notified of the sale of the company just a couple of days before. The new owner then fired most of the employees, it&#x27;s an Italian &quot;tech company&quot; (Bending Spoons) which already bough companies like Evernote, Brightcove or WeTransfer, and has nothing to do with the outdoors. Komoot was the best outdoor-community app in Germany and very popular in Europe, made mostly for hiking and biking.

(2019) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;dark-and-the-long-term&#x2F; (2020 - in which the team is fired to extend runway I guess to today) TL;DR: We’re taking a longer term approach to building Dark. As part of this, we’ve made the difficult decision to shrink Dark’s team, and to change how we build both the product and the company.&quot; So where do we go from here? Right now, the team is just me. I am committed to realizing the full vision of what Dark should be. Dark is financially healthy for many years, and there is time to think and to plan. I plan to involve the community much more in Dark’s growth, and slowly rebuild the team at a pace appropriate to the product’s maturity, focusing on a small, tight team that can wear many hats. Then there was a pivot to a rewrite of the whole thing, which I think was just Paul at the time: Start of a new rewrite: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;dark-v2-roadmap&#x2F; (2020) Two years later: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;backend-rewrite-complete&#x2F; (2022) seemingly a new pivot to &quot;all in&quot; on AI?: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;gpt&#x2F; (2023) No news, one year later https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;an-overdue-status-update&#x2F; (2024) Would be interesting to the Dark team to revisit this post, which is a look at PL funding models: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;how-to-fund-caramel&#x2F; Building programming languages is hard especially when you&#x27;re not backed by a company. I think Eve (I worked on that one) and Dark were the two major VC funded languages, and at this point I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good model for funding this kind of thing. You need waaaaay more that 2-3 million; most of that is funneled directly in to SF landords pockets. Something more like the Mojo people have gotten is what it takes (they&#x27;ve raised upwards of 100 million). Anyway I can&#x27;t wait to see where Dark goes in the future, and what their funding model will be going forward. reply duped 3 hours ago | parent | next [–] &gt; You need waaaaay more that 2-3 million; most of that is funneled directly in to SF landords pockets Which is why you should build your team in Denver, Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, etc. There&#x27;s a competitive advantage to hiring outside the SF tech bubble today.

The problem with doing something revolutionary, is that it&#x27;s only going to be revolutionary in some ways, and it has to compete with things that are mature in ways you are not. And the original version (now called Darklang-Classic) was quite immature in an awful lot of ways that made it difficult to build on.

They were planning some language extensions but it&#x27;s more like a compiler project than a programming language project. The truth is, most developers don&#x27;t want to learn a new language. They will jump through extra hoops just to use their favorite one (e.g. Airflow). Successful languages appear when there is an extreme market demand (C++ providing OOP over C) or, more commonly, a hot new platform that people want to get in on (JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, C#, ...)

In both of the above cases, the founders just got bored of their project before they found PMF. reply cmontella 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You just have to look at the landscape at the time. There was a lot of money to be had if you promised the sun and moon, because $2 million wasn&#x27;t a lot compared to the potential upside. The problem was, and this is what Paul found out too, they wanted to see typical startup metrics before they&#x27;d put more money in, and it was always going to take more than $2-3 mil.

In our discussions, we agreed that continuity of the product was in the best interest of the users and the community (and of both founders and investors, who do not enjoy being blamed for shutting down tools they can no longer afford to run), and we agreed that this could best be achieved by selling it to the employees. Any other examples of that? I&#x27;m particularly interested in that for this kind of software product. reply eddythompson80 20 minutes ago | parent | next [–] &gt; Any other examples of that? I&#x27;m particularly interested in that for this kind of software product. As far as I know, this pattern is not uncommon among traditional businesses. King Arthur Flour Company is the largest one that comes to my mind, but on a local level; grocery stores, restaurants, mechanic shops, plumbing businesses, etc very often &quot;change ownership&quot; this way. In software, it&#x27;s pretty common in informal OSS project to transition ownership this way when the original owner&#x2F;author loses interest or is otherwise unable to maintain the project. In terms of commercial sortware, something like SketchUp comes to mind, though it&#x27;s not exact path. It was a startup, acquired by Google, then spun off again with its employees reply pan69 36 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; an 8 year old product with no traction ... and we agreed that this could best be achieved by selling it to the employees. Can someone with more business sense than me explain this? Why would employees want to buy an 8 year old product with no traction? At face value this sounds like a &quot;holding the bag&quot; scenario, not? reply imadj 3 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] They&#x27;re not buying the product. They&#x27;re buying the company so they can pivot and implement their vision. Basically, the investors lost interest but the team is passionate and see a path to success. They won&#x27;t be maintaining the old product, they&#x27;re going in new direction. reply MichaelGlass 25 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Have you ever been to a great restaurant that happened to be on the wrong corner? Or been at a company where one change in execution made or broke the company? My guess: the founder lost interest but the employees still believed in the [impressive] tech. Because of the lack of traction: the cost of the tech wasn&#x27;t prohibitive for the employees? reply eddythompson80 19 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; &quot;holding the bag&quot; scenario, not? Only if they are buying it for what the investors had already put into it, which is not likely. They most likely discussed how much the investors values physical assets and trademarks the company holds (like how much they are likely to get back in a bankruptcy) plus whatever makes a deal fair and maintain a happy cordial relationship with said investors for future endeavors. reply qwertox 36 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] I wish the owners of Komoot would have done this. They sold the company because they didn&#x27;t see a future of growth, and the employees were notified of the sale of the company just a couple of days before. The new owner then fired most of the employees, it&#x27;s an Italian &quot;tech company&quot; (Bending Spoons) which already bough companies like Evernote, Brightcove or WeTransfer, and has nothing to do with the outdoors. Komoot was the best outdoor-community app in Germany and very popular in Europe, made mostly for hiking and biking. You can see in this really moving video, made by the employees after they got fired, how much they loved their team: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qLJkK4Wn1HI reply ahartmetz 39 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] That seems like an exemplary way to handle a failed rocketship that nevertheless produced something useful to certain customers.

I&#x27;m really disappointed that the project moved away from this because a hosted visual programming environment felt like the whole value proposition in the first place. Was it the pivot to AI that killed this, was it issues with the design of the language or was the structure editor just not as useful as it seemed? reply pbiggar 42 minutes ago | parent | next [–] Stachu is really interested in bringing back the hosted programming environment in some form fyi. Just need to get the basics working first. reply freedomben 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] Was previously &quot;source available&quot; but is now Apache 2. Good choice IMHO! Also looks like it required their cloud setup to run, you previously couldn&#x27;t run it locally. Now you can, so I think it&#x27;s moving in the right direction! reply sisve 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] I guess darklang was too far ahead in their thinking in some areas and choose the wrong path for other. I really liked the deployless idea, but would have loved in even more on-premise. No way to get the data to stay in Europe. Making hard connections between the editor and the lang was interesting also. Seems like they have moved away from that. Hope there is a easy way to set it up locally, i was really intrigued when they first launched reply pbiggar 40 minutes ago | parent | next [–] Yes, the next version will be able to set up locally - you&#x27;ll be able to install a single Darklang binary and run any darklang program without any further steps. See the explanations on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;darklang.com homepage. The issue with the hard connection between the editor and language is that each change becomes a massive undertaking. Making a language improvement was much much much simpler than making the editor change to support it. reply sisve 12 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] It was a bit hard to understand what is coming and what deprecated. As soon as i went into documentation I was send to &quot;darklang classic&quot;. How are the deployless senario now? Where you first serve only yourself then your team, then beta, then everyone...

Relevent timeline: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;dark-announces-3-5m-in-seed-financ... (2019) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;dark-and-the-long-term&#x2F; (2020 - in which the team is fired to extend runway I guess to today) TL;DR: We’re taking a longer term approach to building Dark. As part of this, we’ve made the difficult decision to shrink Dark’s team, and to change how we build both the product and the company.&quot; So where do we go from here? Right now, the team is just me. I am committed to realizing the full vision of what Dark should be. Dark is financially healthy for many years, and there is time to think and to plan. I plan to involve the community much more in Dark’s growth, and slowly rebuild the team at a pace appropriate to the product’s maturity, focusing on a small, tight team that can wear many hats. Then there was a pivot to a rewrite of the whole thing, which I think was just Paul at the time: Start of a new rewrite: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;dark-v2-roadmap&#x2F; (2020) Two years later: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;backend-rewrite-complete&#x2F; (2022) seemingly a new pivot to &quot;all in&quot; on AI?: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;gpt&#x2F; (2023) No news, one year later https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;an-overdue-status-update&#x2F; (2024) Would be interesting to the Dark team to revisit this post, which is a look at PL funding models: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.darklang.com&#x2F;how-to-fund-caramel&#x2F; Building programming languages is hard especially when you&#x27;re not backed by a company. I think Eve (I worked on that one) and Dark were the two major VC funded languages, and at this point I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good model for funding this kind of thing. You need waaaaay more that 2-3 million; most of that is funneled directly in to SF landords pockets. Something more like the Mojo people have gotten is what it takes (they&#x27;ve raised upwards of 100 million). Anyway I can&#x27;t wait to see where Dark goes in the future, and what their funding model will be going forward. reply duped 3 hours ago | parent | next [–] &gt; You need waaaaay more that 2-3 million; most of that is funneled directly in to SF landords pockets Which is why you should build your team in Denver, Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, etc. There&#x27;s a competitive advantage to hiring outside the SF tech bubble today. Over the last 5 years the network effects in SF have begun to evaporate. reply cmontella 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Agreed in hindsight, but at the same time there was no place else where a couple of 20-somethings could grab a cup of coffee with a VC and walk away with a handshake deal for $2 million dollars. That just didn&#x27;t happen in Denver et al in 2014. reply zdragnar 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Does that still happen today? Anecdotally there has appeared to have been a massive funding crunch for pretty much anything that isn&#x27;t virtual healthcare or AI since COVID passed, though I&#x27;ll be the first to admit I&#x27;m not in the know on a lot of these things. reply ChadNauseam 32 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] My anecdata is the opposite.

Like the other comments mention, you need to be worth the time investment to gain traction. If Dark was truly as revolutionary as it was marketed as, it wouldn&#x27;t have had problems staying source available, IMO. Folks will pay or put up with whatever it takes to be in the ecosystem (such as CUDA). reply pbiggar 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I agree it won&#x27;t fit it, but IMO it will remove one of the barriers to adoption. The problem with doing something revolutionary, is that it&#x27;s only going to be revolutionary in some ways, and it has to compete with things that are mature in ways you are not. And the original version (now called Darklang-Classic) was quite immature in an awful lot of ways that made it difficult to build on. That&#x27;s being addressed with the new version of course! reply greener_grass 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Mojo&#x27;s promise is the same code, but faster. They were planning some language extensions but it&#x27;s more like a compiler project than a programming language project. The truth is, most developers don&#x27;t want to learn a new language. They will jump through extra hoops just to use their favorite one (e.g. Airflow). Successful languages appear when there is an extreme market demand (C++ providing OOP over C) or, more commonly, a hot new platform that people want to get in on (JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, C#, ...) For most people, new syntax &#x2F; semantics is considered a negative and there needs to be some massive upside to overcome that. reply gkapur 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] There was also Wing cloud (fka Monada) and there’s Mojo by Modular ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modular.com&#x2F;mojo .) Feels like two types of companies raised money: - Companies trying to couple the cloud with a programming language. - More recently, companies trying to couple GPUs with a programming language&#x2F;alternative to CUDA. Will be curious how this generation goes. reply VirusNewbie 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Mojo was also less ambitious in a lot of ways. It blows my mind the Eve and Darklang guys raised so much money without a lot of momentum. I&#x27;d think you&#x27;d go the other way, start an Open Source project, spend 10+ years gaining a community and refining it, then raise money. In both of the above cases, the founders just got bored of their project before they found PMF. reply cmontella 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You just have to look at the landscape at the time. There was a lot of money to be had if you promised the sun and moon, because $2 million wasn&#x27;t a lot compared to the potential upside. The problem was, and this is what Paul found out too, they wanted to see typical startup metrics before they&#x27;d put more money in, and it was always going to take more than $2-3 mil. You just can&#x27;t demonstrate those with a concept of a language. reply greener_grass 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Do you think Unison will suffer the same fate? reply cmontella 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] No, I mean these low bus factor languages don&#x27;t really die as long as the BDFL keeps working on it.

Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The Guardian Health &amp; wellbeing Meet the members of the Dull Men’s Club: ‘Some of them would bore the ears off you’ An international club where dull people meet online to share the tedium of everyday lives is immensely popular. But for one man it’s a place of poignant connection Get Guardian Australia’s weekend culture and lifestyle email Susan Chenery Sun 8 Jun 2025 16.00 BST Last modified on Mon 9 Jun 2025 06.41 BST Share T he 18th-century English writer Samuel Johnson once wrote, “He is not only dull himself; he is the cause of dullness in others’. It’s a sentiment eagerly embraced by The Dull Men’s Club. Several million members in a number of connected Facebook groups strive to cause dullness in others on a daily basis. In this club, they wear their dullness with pride. The duller the better. This is where the nerds of the world unite. “Posts that contain bitmoji-avatar-things are far too exciting, and will probably get deleted,” warn the rules of the Dull Men’s Club (Australian branch). Maintaining standards of dullness is paramount. Alan Goodwin in the UK recently worried that seeing a lesser spotted woodpecker in his garden might be “a bit too exciting” for the group. In the same week, a flight tracker struggled to keep his excitement to an acceptable level when military jets suddenly appeared on his screen. View image in fullscreen Andrew McKean moved to a care facility after a heart attack. Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The Guardian This is the place for quirky hobbies, obscure interests, the examination of small, ordinary things. It is a place to celebrate the mundane, the quotidian. It is a gentle antidote to pouting influencers and the often toxic internet; a bastion of civility; a polite clarion call to reclaim the ordinary. Above all, it is whimsical, deeply ironic, self-effacing and sarcastic humour. There is an art to being both dull and droll. “It’s tongue-in-cheek humour,” says founder Grover Click (a pseudonym chosen for its dullness). “A safe place to comment on daily things.” Exclamation marks, he says, “are far too exciting.” (On his site, ridicule is against the rules, as is politics, religion, and swearing.) There is, says Bt Humble, a moderator for the Australian branch, “a level of one-upmanship. It’s sort of competitive dullness.” Dull people trying to out-dull each other. View image in fullscreen In his writing, McKean has elevated the dull institutional days into something poetic and poignant. Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The Guardian Are there people who are just too exciting for the club? “There isn’t actually a mandatory level of dullness,” he admits, although some of the members he has met “would bore the ears off you”. It all started in New York in the early 1980s. Click, now 85, and his friends were sitting at the long bar of the New York Athletic club reading magazine articles about boxing, fencing, judo and wrestling. “One of my mates said, ‘Dude, we don’t do any of those things.’” They had to face it. They were dull. They decided to embrace their dullness. As a joke, they started The Dull Men’s Club, which involved some very silly, dull activities. They chartered a tour bus but didn’t go anywhere. “We toured the bus. We walked around the outside of the bus a few times. And the driver explained the tyre pressures and turned on the windscreen wipers.” In 1996, when Click moved to the UK, his nephew offered to build a website for “that silly Dull Men’s Club”. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Today, Click’s copyrighted Dull Men’s Club Facebook group has 1.9 million members. There is an annual calendar featuring people with peculiar hobbies, a book – Dull Men of Great Britain – merchandise and not one but two awards: Anorak of the Year in the UK and DMC Person of the Year for the rest of the world. There are also numerous copycat Dull Men’s Clubs, including one that has 1.7 million members. Click is “very surprised” that so many people identify as dull. The Australian club has 8,000 members. Comparatively small but definitely holding its own in the dullness department. View image in fullscreen Andrew self-publishes books and regularly posts his writing on Facebook group, including the Dull Men’s Club. Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The Guardian Much of the minutiae of life gets on members’ nerves, as does poor workmanship. Five hundred amused comments followed a post about coat hangers inserted into hoops on rails in hotel rooms. “That would keep me up all night,” said one person. The over or under toilet paper debate raged (politely) for two and a half weeks. Then there was the dismantling of electronic appliances. Or photographing post boxes, the ranking of every animated movie from one to 100 – 100 being “dull and pointless”. Members judge the speed of other people’s windscreen wipers against their own, or in the case of Australia’s Simon Molina, stuff as many used toilet rolls as possible inside another. “It’s extremely dull.” There was the late John Richards who founded the Apostrophe Protection Society and 94-year-old Lee Maxwell who has fully restored 1,400 antique washing machines – that no one will ever use. Australian member Andrew McKean, 85, had dullness thrust upon him. He is, dare I say it, an interesting anomaly in the Dull Men’s Club, a shift in tone. Three years ago, he had a heart attack. He recovered but the hospital’s social workers deemed him unable to care for his wife, Patricia, and they moved to a nursing home in New South Wales. There is nothing droll or amusing about being stuck in a nursing home. But he has elevated the dull institutional days into something poetic and poignant by writing about them and posting “to you strangers” in The Dull Men’s Club. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Five Great Reads Free weekly newsletter Each week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The Guardian His life before moving into a home had been anything but dull. An electronics engineer, in 1967 he was connected to the Apollo moon mission. Then a career in the television broadcasting industry took him to the UK, Malta, West Africa and Canada. Once a traveller who lived in a sprawling house at Pittwater who spent his days in the sea, now his life is reduced to a single room – “Every trace of my existence is contained within these walls.” Sitting in his worn, frayed armchair by the window “watching the light shift across the garden, he writes about ageing and “the slow unfolding of a life”. He is surrounded by the “faint hum of machines and the shuffle of slippers … the squeak of a wheelchair, the smell of disinfectant”. With the club, McKean has found his people, his tribe, within this self-deprecating community. At 85, he has found fans. Even if they are proudly dull. He lives for the bus and a few hours of freedom in a life that has shrunk. On the bus “something stirs in us, a flicker of youth perhaps”. He treats himself to KFC, “the sharp tang of it a small rebellion against the home’s bland meals”. View image in fullscreen McKean finds connection to others through his writing. Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The Guardian He sits on a park bench, an old man with a stick, invisible and inconspicuous to the people rushing past “watching the world’s parade, its wealth and hurry”. He observes it all and reports back to the Dull Men’s Club. “Though the world may not stop for me, I will not stop for it. I am here, still breathing, still remembering. And that in itself, is something.” While he usually posts daily, other dull people get concerned if he doesn’t post for a while. They miss him, his wisdom and his beautiful writing. In his introduction to the 2024 Dull Men’s Club calendar, Click wrote: “What they [the dull men] are doing is referred to in Japan as ikigai. It gives a sense of purpose, a motivating force. A reason to jump out of bed in the morning.” Here is a radical thought. Dull men (and women) are actually interesting. Just don’t tell them that.

The entirety of the meshtastic project is web first. - To flash your boards, the suggested method is their &quot;Web Flasher&quot;, and if you download the firmware source, it depends on PlatformIO (and the internet) to download and install the toolchains and flasher programs you need. - The clients for meshtastic are available on the app stores, or as a web app at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;client.meshtastic.org&#x2F; None of these are offline. I did later learn the boards themselves host the web app, but they still have to be connected to an Wifi AP, you don&#x27;t get it just by plugging the board into your computer. - The docs are hosted at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meshtastic.org&#x2F;docs . &quot;Download Docs&quot; or &quot;How to self host this project&quot; are not topics described there or anywhere else. A technical person could figure this out, but this is seemingly not a primary concern. I suppose this is the very point of this post, to get people to have it all set up beforehand, but not even having the docs as a PDF I can read offline? I learned about Meshcore too in this thread, but if I go to their site and the &quot;getting started&quot; guide is a Youtube video, then you&#x27;re not ready for an emergency! reply meehow 0 minutes ago | parent | next [–] - Compiled firmware is available on GitHub, packed together with a script for flashing it. - You can use Meshtastic CLI. - Docs are in git repository in .mdx format: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;meshtastic&#x2F;meshtastic All &quot;sins&quot; you mentioned are results of trying to be more convenient for users used to web browsers. Current state of web is pretty far from being decentralized, including web3. reply amatecha 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I only ever flash via CLI or via &quot;drag &amp; drop&quot; method. The web flasher is great for first-timers but there are 100%-offline methods for all the devices. The android client .apk can be downloaded directly from github at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;meshtastic&#x2F;Meshtastic-Android&#x2F;releases I do agree though, I feel there should be more effort to support &quot;long term lack of internet&quot; use case. reply hosh 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Hearing this is exciting to me, because it is a very concrete and actionable target for a true “local-first” ecosystem and infrastructure. I was very disappointed to find that the “local-first” manifesto was not the “local-first” as I understood it. In my mind, I should be able to connect an app on my phone to another phone via bluetooth, and sync without going through a central server. However, it makes very little economic sense, if someone is building a SAAS product that locks customers into dependencies on a central server where services can be metered and billed. To my mind, those are “offline-first”. I have thought about what it would take to build a local-first software forge and package distribution, and yet, I couldn’t see a good reason to expend that effort. We have a lot of the pieces … with this example — if we want to be able to expand a meshtastic network _after_ a disaster, then the whole tooling, development, etc. needs to be local-first and resilient. reply wao0uuno 9 hours ago | prev | next [–] I tested meshtastic in a major european city with pretty much 100% mesh coverage and its real life performance was quite underwhelming. Often I would receive messages that I could not reply to because of differences in antenna gain and crappy mesh performance. Public chat was either completely dead or flooded with test messages. Everything was super slow because the mesh can’t actually scale that well and craps out with more than a 100 nodes. Even medium fast channel would clog up fast. I would never depend on meshtastic during an emergency because it barely works even when nobody is using it. I think a public wifi mesh would be more worthwhile. Older used wifi routers are pretty much free and in unlimited supply. They use very little power. Everyone already has a compatible client device on their pocket. Sure the mesh would fail during a total blackout but at least it would be useful for something when the power is up. reply TeamMCS 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] I agree with this assessment. I&#x27;ve been running two nodes for about a year, maybe longer, and in that time, I&#x27;ve only had perhaps two contacts. Even with a YAGI or a dedicated pole antenna, both tuned to 868 MHz, the range in my location is quite poor. The signal seems to drop off quickly, even after walking just a kilometer down the road. While I understand that height is key (and my antennas are fairly high), it appears that 868 MHz attenuates very rapidly. So, to reiterate, I don&#x27;t believe Meshtastic is a particularly effective solution. The principle behind it is sound, but the practical execution falls short. I think established methods like Hamnet and traditional amateur radio are far superior, especially now with SDRs making a simple handheld radio incredibly affordable (around €20) reply hyperionplays 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Have you tried the Reticulum network? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reticulum.network I have been meaning to try it out https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unsigned.io&#x2F;rnode&#x2F; reply TeamMCS 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I can&#x27;t say I have. Let me look into it. Thanks for the share reply adrianN 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Wifi routers use quite a lot of power for the area that they can cover. Ten watts or so for a hundred square meters is a lot of you want to cover a whole city. reply wao0uuno 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Almost everyone has one of these running 24&#x2F;7 already. Second one with an external antenna wouldn’t make much difference. reply Aachen 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Everyone currently has electricity on demand reply wao0uuno 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Ukrainian grid has been targeted by russian drone and missile strikes for years and it just keeps coming back. Longest downtime (according to a quick google search) was approximately 12 hours. Complete long term blackout in a big European city is very unlikely these days. reply pmontra 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Long term as &quot;days&quot;, yes. But all of Spain had a blackout for at least 12 hours a few weeks ago. Turin, Italy, had a 10 hours blackout yesterday. reply PokemonNoGo 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Makes me more impressed by the Ukranians honestly! After Russia is banished they can teach the rest of Europe what resilience looks like in this area. reply GardenLetter27 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Yeah, having gone through the blackout in Spain this would be really useful (using phones). Then only one person needs a generator and&#x2F;or Starlink to provide some connectivity. reply moffkalast 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It&#x27;s interesting how we&#x27;re generally headed towards general self sufficiency, off grid solar and wind power with batteries because the grid won&#x27;t pay you to sell it electricity, mesh networks and satellite internet to get around lazy local ISPs. All we need is a field where robots grow food and we&#x27;re back in the middle ages but with modern tech. We&#x27;ve even got tech billionaires to stand in as feudal lords and crazy right wing populists instead of inbred kings with weird chins. reply edent 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Where in the world are you? In the UK I get paid to sell my excess solar back to the grid. reply moffkalast 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That&#x27;s usually the case if there&#x27;s only a few people with solar or if your local infrastructure is overbuilt, since grids typically aren&#x27;t designed to handle residential power generation. If there&#x27;s too much solar in your area (which will be the eventual end result everywhere) you get net billing, where you don’t get charged for the energy you use, but they won&#x27;t pay you a dime for anything over what you use or will even disconnect you if you overproduce so the local substation doesn&#x27;t explode because it wasn&#x27;t specced for any of this shit.

Ready.gov has instructions. &gt; Should everyone have several hundred gallons of gasoline stored in their garage just incase? oh, c&#x27;mon. Do you or any one person you know use several hundred gallons of gas over the course of a few days on critical things? If that is the case, then yes, by all means you should have a private gasoline backup supply since you are running some sort of industrial scale operation. If you are worried about it, just make sure you have a several day supply of gasoline on hand. For most people that use about a tank of gas per week that means filling up when you are at half tank. For those of us, like me, who live in a place where a generator is occasionally useful, a couple of jerry cans full of gas are typically already on hand. Hundreds of gallons could keep me powered up for weeks at a minimum unless I was really trying to use a lot of power. For most people, gasoline is used exclusively for their car, which has a multi-day gas supply storage mechanism built in. Lets say we require all gas stations to have the ability to pump gas during a blackout. Then what? It doesn&#x27;t solve any of your hypotheticals. Without a beefy generator and a professional crossover switch, you aren&#x27;t powering your home with gasoline. What is a working gas station going to do for a renter, or apartment dweller? In any case. If things get actually desperate, it isn&#x27;t that hard for a handy person to wire a generator up on the spot, and get gas pumping, although at that point, what are the chances that the payment network is online. At that point you can just run the pump by hand if it&#x27;s truly desperate. &gt; Suggesting individuals prepare for this seems equally absurd, does it not? Not absurd at all. Experts and the government actually suggest that people do some of their own preparations for disasters. They suggest that you have enough on hand to survive for 48 hours without outside help. There are entire government initiatives, campaigns and organizations based on this exact premise. Check out Ready.gov for the USA federal version. You can probably find state and local level initiatives where you are too, if in the US.

Only one gas station in down was in an area that still had power. If you don’t live in so cal and have to deal with public safety power shutoffs, quit talking out of your ass. Our power grid is so unreliable here that they really need to make the gas infrastructure more resilient. When shit goes down, people need to be able to get fuel. The populace at large is never going to be prepared enough to deal with every gas station in the area going down. Raise the cost of gas by 10 cents to cover the costs. If every station is mandated to do so then they won’t have any issues with the margins as they will simply all raise prices in concert. reply dghlsakjg 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don&#x27;t live in SoCal. I live in rural Canada where I get several power outages per year due to inclement weather downing lines. It sounds like there wasn&#x27;t really a problem with gas availability, in your case. You were able to get enough gas to comfortably power a generator with no preparation during one of the biggest emergencies the city has ever seen. During the LA fires, the power cuts were to small enough areas that you could have just driven to a different area of the city. That sounds inconvenient, but hardly worth the effort of building independent power generation sources for the 10k+ gas stations in your state. A far better solution is to do what we do in my part of Canada: a competently run power company that doesn&#x27;t arbitrarily shut off power due to failing infrastructure setting billions of dollars worth of city on fire. We don&#x27;t have PSPS&#x27;s despite living in a very fire prone place with extreme weather because our infrastructure is maintained much better.

But yeah, my vision is pretty much just SSB all grown up. reply roguecoder 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] America is sprawling, unfortunately. That kind of approach would work in cities, but would be much less effective where people aren&#x27;t taking the bus or even being around other people on a daily basis. The advantage of something that can reach 6 miles is that it could cover suburbia and rural areas with ~20-40 acre plots relatively effectively. reply __MatrixMan__ 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah it&#x27;s not ideal for sparse populations but I think you could get a lot of coverage by just running a node with a solar panel wherever your mailbox is and also having your mail driver put a node in their vehicle. Really the thing I&#x27;m trying to push back against is the idea that the entire path between them must be connected all at once in order for two parties to communicate. If we design for short range, partition-tolerant, pocket-to-pocket background gossip, then that same protocol will work just fine if you attach specialty radio hardware and give it miles worth of range, and you&#x27;ve still got the fallback ready for cases where all you have is consumer grade hardware. On the other hand, if you design for persistent connectivity and then try to use it in an intermittently-connected context, you&#x27;re going to have a much worse time. reply hashstring 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; to carry &quot;internet&quot; traffic on a filesystem in their pocket. What do you mean? reply __MatrixMan__ 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Well &quot;internet&quot; gets quotes because if the source and the destination are disconnected when the message arrives then they&#x27;re not on the internet. It might look something like this: As you stand in line at the grocery store your device notices that a nearby device (the guy behind you) belongs to somebody who is trusted by one of your peers in the &quot;gardening&quot; topic. You&#x27;re not a gardener, but your room mate is. So your device pulls a gardening related update from their device. Then as you head home with groceries your device is not connected to anything, it&#x27;s just sitting in your pocket with a filesystem full of data. And then when you get home your roommate&#x27;s device gets a notification about a reply to their question on a gardening related message board. That data came to them on your device. It traveled a few feet wirelessly at the grocery store, and a few feet wirelessly at home, but the majority of the transit was handled the slow way, by hitching a ride on a human who was traveling that way anyhow. It would only work for small bits of latency tolerant data, and work best for information of broad interest (not so great for an encrypted email to a single party, pretty good for map tiles, open&#x2F;closed hours, restaurant menus, etc). The simplest app to build on such a platform would be a sort of of distributed BBS. VoIP would be nearly impossible. But I think that small snippets of high latency text can get you pretty far. reply hashstring 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Interesting idea, thanks now I understand! reply bmn__ 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sneakernet reply lambdaone 8 hours ago | prev | next [–] Mesh radio bandwidth is pretty poor. Firstly, you have to compete with many interferers (albeit this might get better if the power goes down), including other LoRa radios, but more to the point, long-distance connections consume bandwidth and aquire delay and delay variation at every intermediate hop. It might be reasonable to use it for text messaging, but with per-hop bandwidth ranging from 0.3 kbps to 27 kbps, which will get divided down further over shared multi-hop links it will be impractical to use it for anything else except perhaps very-low-bandwidth telephony over short distances or visiting minimalist text-only websites. It might make more sense if augmented by fixed multi-megabit point-to-point microwave radio links to act as a backbone, with LoRa only functioning as an access network. I&#x27;d be interested to hear what experiences people have had with doing this for real. reply bkummel 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] I think the point of the article is not to use that mesh network as a replacement for internet.

With tall buildings as hubs, you might actually be able to build a decent mesh, with WiFi, LoRa or both acting as access networks. You&#x27;d definitely want to throttle per-client bandwidth to prevent people from abusing your very limited long-range mesh bandwidth. None of this would be cheap; decent microwave links cost thousands, and you&#x27;d need backup solar and battery power for every part of the network. I&#x27;d also consider thinking about using the &quot;big ears, small mouth&quot; technique to push up bandwidth; if a fixed link using a technology such as LoRa could transmit at a legal EIRP level, but coupled this with a really high gain parabolic dish (I&#x27;m thinking re-purposed satellite dishes) and low-noise amplifier at each end on the receive side, you could get substantially higher end-to-end Eb&#x2F;No, and thus much higher bandwidth and range than would otherwise be legally possible. At first glance, the necessary hardware to do this looks quite doable, either by active RF switching between antennae, or the use of a hybrid&#x2F;circulator to do the necessary duplexing. I&#x27;d be interested to see if anyone has already built, or even manufactures, something like this, and what the practical and regulatory barriers are to implementation. reply myself248 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &quot;Big ears, small mouth&quot; is exactly what the regulations are designed to encourage, so I don&#x27;t foresee regulatory issues. You don&#x27;t even need extra hardware for the duplexing; the common SX1276 chip has separate Tx and Rx pins which are typically combined on the PCB. All you need is to route a PCB that brings &#x27;em out separately, if that&#x27;s what you want to do. In practice it&#x27;s tricky to aim two dishes the exact same place, so using a single dish with a single antenna at its focus is probably quite a bit more practical. The SX1276 also has a PA control pin, invert that and you&#x27;ve got your LNA control signal. Or don&#x27;t bother with the LNA, and simply mount the transceiver at the focus to minimize RF feedline losses. You&#x27;d give up a smidgen of performance but gain a lot of simplicity. (There would still be coax running down the boom, but it would be carrying the wifi&#x2F;bluetooth signal outside the dish&#x27;s aperture!) reply lambdaone 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I didn&#x27;t know about the chip having separate TX and RX pins. There must be a gap in the market for rooftop-to-rooftop LoRa transceivers that don&#x27;t cost a fortune. Even using something like a 24 dB gain antenna would push range up by a factor of 10 relative to a simple 4 dB antenna, or get a substantial improvement in bandwidth&#x2F;reliability at the same range. For an even simpler design, you could just put a 20 dB attenuator between the transmit port and the antenna, reducing the effective forward gain of 4 dB, while getting the full 24 dB in the opposite direction.

With laser one could send incredibly large amounts of data very fast. It&#x27;s more manual setup but I would expect once set up it would be far more reliable, better for setting up mountain top repeaters and meshes. Laser is also better for data privacy encryption aside as the beam is directed to a target vs. omnidirectional broadcasting. During grid-down most people that would be using a mesh would be at static locations. One could then bridge in these RF omnidirectional devices into the mountain and home repeaters to prevent over-saturation. Another nifty feature of a manually positioned laser is the automatic measurement of time domain. One could have an optional security feature to automatically disable the data-stream if the time domain of the laser changes in physical distance of more than {n} user-defined meters or centimeters to prevent MitM (Monster in the Middle) beam interception for the extra properly paranoid types. There can be weather issues for laser but for that one could fall back to voice using any one of the hundreds of makes and models of HAM gear that can operate on and around 11 meters by moving a jumper or holding down two buttons when it is powered on. Illegal but only enforced by monthly example of someone impacting revenue generating sites. Voice changers and scramblers FTW. RF signature ignored. Don&#x27;t use sloppy SDR&#x27;s.

The biggest thing was the company had a fiscal and cultural conservative bent; quite unusual in the tech industry, these days.

Only then can you break other rules (eg power limits) in situations described in rule 403 you linked above. Without a licence, a radio is just a radio, eg. a business band radio (like many motorolas are), and nothing in the part 97 (regulating amateur radio) applies to the user of that radio. Only when a licenced ham uses that (or any other radio, or even a homemade transmitter), in a specific way (described above) that &quot;just-a-radio&quot; becomes an amateur station. reply nunobrito 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Again with FUD. In Portugal you are legally permitted to use channel 9 (27.065 MHz) in addition to the PMR channels. The hard line has always been on public safety bands. From a long time cooperation with the authorities (especially around the Azores) there was always an informal permission for that kind of usage across boats and islands because communication is difficult there. Last but not least: taking the radio license exam is NOT a drama. Anyone can apply and get the radio license when they are serious into this topic. reply ajsnigrutin 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] What fud? Channel 9 is a CB channel, and neither quanshengs nor baofengs work on those frequencies at all, but you need a certified&#x2F;type-accepted CB radio to use on that frequency. Same with PMR, you need a PMR radio to use on pmr frequencies. It&#x27;s not FUD, it&#x27;s just hardware limits and regulation. Yes, 12yo kids can get an amateur radio licence, it&#x27;s easy, but you still need a licence to transmit on ham bands, and you still cannot legally use a baofeng (except the few pmr models) or a quansheng on PMR frequencies, those radios don&#x27;t transmit on cb freqencies at all, and there are no legal &quot;you don&#x27;t need a licence in an emergency&quot; exceptions. reply harvey9 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I have a ham radio and still not got around to getting my license.

You will in turn have to share the road with him in the same way as other radio amateurs (and possibly rescue services) will have to share the spectrum with you. You transmitting on a repeaters input frequency without a subtone set will in turn jam the repeater (PLL is before the TSQL) will make communications impossible in the same way as your neigbor stuck in the middle of the road with a burnt clutch will make driving impossible for others.

You lose a tremendous tactical advantage in this situation if you’ve never met any local radio operators, gotten a sense of where they live and what they do for a living. Some are skilled experts. Some are blowhards who confidently give bad advice. Some live near you. Some are 100 miles away. You can figure it out, but it takes time that you don’t have in the middle of a disaster.

In most countries emergency services have moved over to tetra or dmr, with encryption, and all the public related info is broadcasted on &quot;normal&quot; broadcast fm, where you need a normal fm radio, not a ham transciever. reply nunobrito 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That is a question you can answer yourself when trying it out. In Portugal +90% of tetra stopped working. DMR only locally. Satellite APRS continued working. Who will listen? Well, those from north to south on the country were listening. More important, they were listening who was still active because those were the stations running with their own energy because even FM stations started to go down quickly as the generators ran out of fuel. Had the blackdown lasted a week, those with a 20 euros walkie-talkies would very likely be the only ones still capable of +50 km distance communications and +1700 km reach using satellite APRS text messages.

But the wider point is generally that just because something is less effective doesn&#x27;t make it useless, and just because something is effective doesn&#x27;t make it dominating . If an enemy has an artillery advantage, then shelling obvious decoys is still taking decoys off the field, which you now need to replace. But worse, their existence is giving away the fact you&#x27;re active in the area, and their placement is giving away your operational range - i.e. how far can a person move on foot over rough terrain? How far in a vehicle? etc. What&#x27;s the effective range of their normal infantry weapons - if you know there&#x27;s a decoy then the trap has a specific radius if it is a trap. All on the bet that they will in fact run out of shells - or in the case of drones, they won&#x27;t even run out since a drone can much more easily be re-targeted. reply looofooo0 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Well you entering deep level of game theory here. Can you distinguish the decoy from the real and what resources you need to spend (e.g. LoRa device in a home)? How much is the signal that you can deploy decoys worth?

You can run LoRa from a small power bank for days, or run it off of a small battery and solar panel indefinitely. Wifi is much more power hungry. Wifi also doesn&#x27;t offer kilometres of range, making that power cost largely wasteful. In an emergency, if you have limited power, WiFi will exclude 100% of the population simply because it&#x27;s not practical to operate at all. LoRa, even if it enables 0.01% of the population (primarily experts in the technology) in that emergency, is a greater benefit to everyone at that time. WiFi is a peace time technology based around a rich infrastructure that is not resilient in emergencies. If you skimmed the article you should check it out again. She details this stuff, and it&#x27;s actually really interesting and worth understanding if you&#x27;re into this stuff: LoRa radios have several advantages for use in emergency communications: no centralized infrastructure needed no license needed cheap (starting at ~€20) low-power (&lt; 1W, can power with an ordinary mobile phone powerbank) runs open source Meshtastic firmware can send text messages across several line-of-sight hops (several kms) can connect via Bluetooth or WiFi to phones&#x2F;computers many urban areas have a good Meshtastic network already reply 7373737373 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] WiFi (with extra hardware, mostly antennas&#x2F;routers, not too expensive anymore either) CAN offer (even tens of) kilometers of range, at least point to point: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lYJFwXw1ZIc https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eu.store.ui.com&#x2F;eu&#x2F;en&#x2F;category&#x2F;wireless-ltu-5ghz&#x2F;pro... only 9W max power consumption too! well, that&#x27;s not a few hundred milliwatts, still, better then ye olde lightbulb PLUS gigabit throughput if only our network stacks and protocols didn&#x27;t assume hierarchical (local) networks by default, and kernels included p2p network stacks, then i&#x27;d feel more confident about blackouts being handled more gracefully well, i suppose all this depends heavily on the nature of the emergency generally i&#x27;m surprised that the sheer computational power of modern smartphones are not used more for this purpose, i haven&#x27;t come across much true p2p software on another note, there is still no (truly) cross-platform https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AirDrop standard (especially one without artificial limitations), which is a shame also i want to note that smartphones can even communicate directly with satellites now: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=v30z-0bGbHQ reply steve_adams_86 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, I use my phone over satellite regularly now. It&#x27;s still amazing to me that it&#x27;s possible. Phones are a great tool here because everyone truly does have them, they&#x27;re portable, and they have large rechargeable batteries that can charge from countless sources over USB. So, it does seem like we could use them to great effect to create networks when other systems go down. I&#x27;m not sure they can handle long range comms due to requiring antennas, but close-range in cities might work well. I&#x27;m not sure what routing on that mesh would look like, or how busy it would get and how well phones could handle that. Satellites could be an important component here, but there&#x27;s always the need for redundancy. They can be compromised too, and you don&#x27;t own them. The LTU Extreme Range hardware is way, way more expensive than a LoRa radio, and it still uses quite a bit of power (relatively). It still seems far from ideal in situations where you can&#x27;t depend on power utilities. Great point though, I wasn&#x27;t aware that exists.

Try to avoid understanding this difficulty from your own shoes, but rather from the shoes of communities very limited on what is reachable to them from a technical, financial and logistical point of view.

One that is less data hungry, less commercial, but still sustainable (how?), more of a community vibe, with distributed governance, less enshittification. Think of it like a maintainable garden. One that still works without a lot of extra effort, such as constant browser &#x27;innovations&#x27; or bandwidth upgrades. Something more like a hardscaped garden instead of a typical American-style monoculture grass lawn requiring nonstop interventions to make it look pristine.

Beg to disagree here. 30 dollars for a cheap-ass Quansheng will get you pretty far as long as a repeater is in reach (if it&#x27;s Echolink capable, worldwide), and a bunch of repeaters for all kinds of modes are tied together not only via the Internet but also via AMPR &#x2F; HamNet [1]. APRS and DMR capable devices are in the 200 dollar range. For high bandwidth data communication it becomes a bit more involved - Ubiquiti hardware for example can be trivially software-modified to transmit on the amateur radio ranges, which is how that gear ends up powering a lot of HamNet stations. Sadly, unless there&#x27;s a HamNet node on a nearby large structure you&#x27;ll probably need to raise a tower large enough to achieve line-of-sight to the nearest HamNet node.

The entirety of the meshtastic project is web first. - To flash your boards, the suggested method is their &quot;Web Flasher&quot;, and if you download the firmware source, it depends on PlatformIO (and the internet) to download and install the toolchains and flasher programs you need. - The clients for meshtastic are available on the app stores, or as a web app at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;client.meshtastic.org&#x2F; None of these are offline. I did later learn the boards themselves host the web app, but they still have to be connected to an Wifi AP, you don&#x27;t get it just by plugging the board into your computer. - The docs are hosted at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meshtastic.org&#x2F;docs . &quot;Download Docs&quot; or &quot;How to self host this project&quot; are not topics described there or anywhere else. A technical person could figure this out, but this is seemingly not a primary concern. I suppose this is the very point of this post, to get people to have it all set up beforehand, but not even having the docs as a PDF I can read offline? I learned about Meshcore too in this thread, but if I go to their site and the &quot;getting started&quot; guide is a Youtube video, then you&#x27;re not ready for an emergency! reply meehow 0 minutes ago | parent | next [–] - Compiled firmware is available on GitHub, packed together with a script for flashing it. - You can use Meshtastic CLI. - Docs are in git repository in .mdx format: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;meshtastic&#x2F;meshtastic All &quot;sins&quot; you mentioned are results of trying to be more convenient for users used to web browsers.

I was very disappointed to find that the “local-first” manifesto was not the “local-first” as I understood it. In my mind, I should be able to connect an app on my phone to another phone via bluetooth, and sync without going through a central server. However, it makes very little economic sense, if someone is building a SAAS product that locks customers into dependencies on a central server where services can be metered and billed. To my mind, those are “offline-first”. I have thought about what it would take to build a local-first software forge and package distribution, and yet, I couldn’t see a good reason to expend that effort. We have a lot of the pieces … with this example — if we want to be able to expand a meshtastic network _after_ a disaster, then the whole tooling, development, etc. needs to be local-first and resilient. reply wao0uuno 9 hours ago | prev | next [–] I tested meshtastic in a major european city with pretty much 100% mesh coverage and its real life performance was quite underwhelming. Often I would receive messages that I could not reply to because of differences in antenna gain and crappy mesh performance. Public chat was either completely dead or flooded with test messages. Everything was super slow because the mesh can’t actually scale that well and craps out with more than a 100 nodes. Even medium fast channel would clog up fast. I would never depend on meshtastic during an emergency because it barely works even when nobody is using it. I think a public wifi mesh would be more worthwhile. Older used wifi routers are pretty much free and in unlimited supply. They use very little power. Everyone already has a compatible client device on their pocket. Sure the mesh would fail during a total blackout but at least it would be useful for something when the power is up. reply TeamMCS 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] I agree with this assessment. I&#x27;ve been running two nodes for about a year, maybe longer, and in that time, I&#x27;ve only had perhaps two contacts. Even with a YAGI or a dedicated pole antenna, both tuned to 868 MHz, the range in my location is quite poor. The signal seems to drop off quickly, even after walking just a kilometer down the road. While I understand that height is key (and my antennas are fairly high), it appears that 868 MHz attenuates very rapidly. So, to reiterate, I don&#x27;t believe Meshtastic is a particularly effective solution. The principle behind it is sound, but the practical execution falls short.

If there&#x27;s too much solar in your area (which will be the eventual end result everywhere) you get net billing, where you don’t get charged for the energy you use, but they won&#x27;t pay you a dime for anything over what you use or will even disconnect you if you overproduce so the local substation doesn&#x27;t explode because it wasn&#x27;t specced for any of this shit.

It seems to me that these modern anti-social tendencies are actively driving a wedge between most people and their surroundings, making people further isolated from each other. Young people tend to spend time in doors alone because they don&#x27;t know _how_ to interact with strangers. But they should because being alone is literally damaging to your health. Being far away from friends is bad for you[1]. Being socially isolated is bad for you.

I was in college at the time, but home for a few days. I heard rumors that the power was on west of us (where my school was), so I just started driving west, hoping I found where the power was on before I ran out of gas. Thankfully, that worked out.

Requiring every single one of them to invest in a 5-6 figure power backup solution with hundreds or thousands in yearly maintenance costs, so they can sell their lowest margin product to accommodate those who can&#x27;t plan ahead during a disaster that happens maybe once in a decade event is pretty absurd. reply al_borland 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] How does one plan ahead for a multi-day regional power failure, that may only happen once in their lifetime? Should everyone have several hundred gallons of gasoline stored in their garage just incase?

Ready.gov has instructions. &gt; Should everyone have several hundred gallons of gasoline stored in their garage just incase? oh, c&#x27;mon. Do you or any one person you know use several hundred gallons of gas over the course of a few days on critical things? If that is the case, then yes, by all means you should have a private gasoline backup supply since you are running some sort of industrial scale operation. If you are worried about it, just make sure you have a several day supply of gasoline on hand. For most people that use about a tank of gas per week that means filling up when you are at half tank. For those of us, like me, who live in a place where a generator is occasionally useful, a couple of jerry cans full of gas are typically already on hand. Hundreds of gallons could keep me powered up for weeks at a minimum unless I was really trying to use a lot of power. For most people, gasoline is used exclusively for their car, which has a multi-day gas supply storage mechanism built in. Lets say we require all gas stations to have the ability to pump gas during a blackout. Then what? It doesn&#x27;t solve any of your hypotheticals. Without a beefy generator and a professional crossover switch, you aren&#x27;t powering your home with gasoline. What is a working gas station going to do for a renter, or apartment dweller? In any case. If things get actually desperate, it isn&#x27;t that hard for a handy person to wire a generator up on the spot, and get gas pumping, although at that point, what are the chances that the payment network is online. At that point you can just run the pump by hand if it&#x27;s truly desperate. &gt; Suggesting individuals prepare for this seems equally absurd, does it not? Not absurd at all. Experts and the government actually suggest that people do some of their own preparations for disasters. They suggest that you have enough on hand to survive for 48 hours without outside help. There are entire government initiatives, campaigns and organizations based on this exact premise. Check out Ready.gov for the USA federal version. You can probably find state and local level initiatives where you are too, if in the US.

Only one gas station in down was in an area that still had power. If you don’t live in so cal and have to deal with public safety power shutoffs, quit talking out of your ass. Our power grid is so unreliable here that they really need to make the gas infrastructure more resilient. When shit goes down, people need to be able to get fuel. The populace at large is never going to be prepared enough to deal with every gas station in the area going down. Raise the cost of gas by 10 cents to cover the costs. If every station is mandated to do so then they won’t have any issues with the margins as they will simply all raise prices in concert. reply dghlsakjg 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don&#x27;t live in SoCal. I live in rural Canada where I get several power outages per year due to inclement weather downing lines. It sounds like there wasn&#x27;t really a problem with gas availability, in your case. You were able to get enough gas to comfortably power a generator with no preparation during one of the biggest emergencies the city has ever seen. During the LA fires, the power cuts were to small enough areas that you could have just driven to a different area of the city. That sounds inconvenient, but hardly worth the effort of building independent power generation sources for the 10k+ gas stations in your state. A far better solution is to do what we do in my part of Canada: a competently run power company that doesn&#x27;t arbitrarily shut off power due to failing infrastructure setting billions of dollars worth of city on fire. We don&#x27;t have PSPS&#x27;s despite living in a very fire prone place with extreme weather because our infrastructure is maintained much better. Instead of forcing everyone to subsidize individual power plants for gas stations to do long tail risk mitigation, California should maybe invest in a grid that doesn&#x27;t regularly cause billion dollar fires. reply 20after4 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] You make a great point.

You just get a different type of threat landscape when each hop is also an opportunity to shake somebody&#x27;s hand and attest that the holder of their private key is a real human. It creates a minimal trust layer you can then build on. You don&#x27;t get that with a hardware address found drifting on the wind. Both modes have some potential to attract harmful attention to network operators based on the behavior of their users, but to a very different degree. So far as I know nobody is kicking down meshtastic operators&#x27; doors looking to follow a transmission to its source, but I think that would change if the other modes of long range skulduggery were to fail.

What do you mean? reply __MatrixMan__ 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Well &quot;internet&quot; gets quotes because if the source and the destination are disconnected when the message arrives then they&#x27;re not on the internet. It might look something like this: As you stand in line at the grocery store your device notices that a nearby device (the guy behind you) belongs to somebody who is trusted by one of your peers in the &quot;gardening&quot; topic. You&#x27;re not a gardener, but your room mate is. So your device pulls a gardening related update from their device. Then as you head home with groceries your device is not connected to anything, it&#x27;s just sitting in your pocket with a filesystem full of data. And then when you get home your roommate&#x27;s device gets a notification about a reply to their question on a gardening related message board. That data came to them on your device. It traveled a few feet wirelessly at the grocery store, and a few feet wirelessly at home, but the majority of the transit was handled the slow way, by hitching a ride on a human who was traveling that way anyhow. It would only work for small bits of latency tolerant data, and work best for information of broad interest (not so great for an encrypted email to a single party, pretty good for map tiles, open&#x2F;closed hours, restaurant menus, etc). The simplest app to build on such a platform would be a sort of of distributed BBS. VoIP would be nearly impossible.

Firstly, you have to compete with many interferers (albeit this might get better if the power goes down), including other LoRa radios, but more to the point, long-distance connections consume bandwidth and aquire delay and delay variation at every intermediate hop. It might be reasonable to use it for text messaging, but with per-hop bandwidth ranging from 0.3 kbps to 27 kbps, which will get divided down further over shared multi-hop links it will be impractical to use it for anything else except perhaps very-low-bandwidth telephony over short distances or visiting minimalist text-only websites.

You&#x27;d definitely want to throttle per-client bandwidth to prevent people from abusing your very limited long-range mesh bandwidth. None of this would be cheap; decent microwave links cost thousands, and you&#x27;d need backup solar and battery power for every part of the network. I&#x27;d also consider thinking about using the &quot;big ears, small mouth&quot; technique to push up bandwidth; if a fixed link using a technology such as LoRa could transmit at a legal EIRP level, but coupled this with a really high gain parabolic dish (I&#x27;m thinking re-purposed satellite dishes) and low-noise amplifier at each end on the receive side, you could get substantially higher end-to-end Eb&#x2F;No, and thus much higher bandwidth and range than would otherwise be legally possible. At first glance, the necessary hardware to do this looks quite doable, either by active RF switching between antennae, or the use of a hybrid&#x2F;circulator to do the necessary duplexing. I&#x27;d be interested to see if anyone has already built, or even manufactures, something like this, and what the practical and regulatory barriers are to implementation. reply myself248 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &quot;Big ears, small mouth&quot; is exactly what the regulations are designed to encourage, so I don&#x27;t foresee regulatory issues. You don&#x27;t even need extra hardware for the duplexing; the common SX1276 chip has separate Tx and Rx pins which are typically combined on the PCB. All you need is to route a PCB that brings &#x27;em out separately, if that&#x27;s what you want to do. In practice it&#x27;s tricky to aim two dishes the exact same place, so using a single dish with a single antenna at its focus is probably quite a bit more practical. The SX1276 also has a PA control pin, invert that and you&#x27;ve got your LNA control signal. Or don&#x27;t bother with the LNA, and simply mount the transceiver at the focus to minimize RF feedline losses. You&#x27;d give up a smidgen of performance but gain a lot of simplicity. (There would still be coax running down the boom, but it would be carrying the wifi&#x2F;bluetooth signal outside the dish&#x27;s aperture!) reply lambdaone 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I didn&#x27;t know about the chip having separate TX and RX pins. There must be a gap in the market for rooftop-to-rooftop LoRa transceivers that don&#x27;t cost a fortune. Even using something like a 24 dB gain antenna would push range up by a factor of 10 relative to a simple 4 dB antenna, or get a substantial improvement in bandwidth&#x2F;reliability at the same range. For an even simpler design, you could just put a 20 dB attenuator between the transmit port and the antenna, reducing the effective forward gain of 4 dB, while getting the full 24 dB in the opposite direction. Proper RF engineering details an exercise for the student etc. reply hadlock 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Google &quot;cantenna&quot; made from a pringles can. reply eimrine 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] That&#x27;s true and proprietary modulation makes the situation worse. reply liotier 11 hours ago | prev | next [–] Mesh networks are the foundation - they are essential to disaster resilience.

With laser one could send incredibly large amounts of data very fast. It&#x27;s more manual setup but I would expect once set up it would be far more reliable, better for setting up mountain top repeaters and meshes. Laser is also better for data privacy encryption aside as the beam is directed to a target vs. omnidirectional broadcasting. During grid-down most people that would be using a mesh would be at static locations. One could then bridge in these RF omnidirectional devices into the mountain and home repeaters to prevent over-saturation. Another nifty feature of a manually positioned laser is the automatic measurement of time domain. One could have an optional security feature to automatically disable the data-stream if the time domain of the laser changes in physical distance of more than {n} user-defined meters or centimeters to prevent MitM (Monster in the Middle) beam interception for the extra properly paranoid types. There can be weather issues for laser but for that one could fall back to voice using any one of the hundreds of makes and models of HAM gear that can operate on and around 11 meters by moving a jumper or holding down two buttons when it is powered on. Illegal but only enforced by monthly example of someone impacting revenue generating sites. Voice changers and scramblers FTW. RF signature ignored. Don&#x27;t use sloppy SDR&#x27;s.

I was fortunate to have worked for a company that is over 100 years old, and that had weathered a couple of wars, depression, recession, market disruption, etc. They were about as open to disaster planning as anyone, but they could also be head-in-the-sand knuckleheads. The biggest thing was the company had a fiscal and cultural conservative bent; quite unusual in the tech industry, these days.

APRS is a bit better, because it requires ham licences and (usually) a bit more expensive equipment, but with &quot;SmartBeaconing&quot; and just a few hams, you get collisions (multiple people transmitting at the same time, effectively jamming eachother). Reddit is usually full of preppers and other idiots buying these cheap chinese radios, usually without any knowledge and licences (that are needed to use them), and in turn they know nothing about actual use of those devices.... simplex range in urban environment is measured in hundreds of meters or maybe one or two large buildings between radioss, and repeaters will be in use by actual emergency servics and not really usable for any kind of &quot;private use&quot;. tldr: get a few books, a pack of cards, wait it out, not so long ago being unreachable away from home was the norm, and we managed. reply akvadrako 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] On the other hand, getting a license is pretty easy.

This rules applies to: &gt; the use by an amateur station Not every billy and bobby with a baofeng are an amateur station. Luckily, at the beginning of part 97 there are definitions of such words (you have to open the full document, not just this article) &gt; Amateur station. A station in an amateur radio service consisting of the apparatus necessary for carrying on radiocommunications. So, for something to be an &quot;amateur station&quot;, you need an &quot;apparatus&quot; (some kind of radio transmitter) and it has to be a part of &quot;amateur radio service&quot;. That too is defined in the same document: &gt; Amateur radio services. The amateur service, the amateur-satellite service and the radio amateur civil emergency service. It&#x27;s not RACES (that&#x27;s defined below), not satellite, so let&#x27;s see what &quot;amateur service is&quot;, again, definition in the same document &gt; Amateur service. A radiocommunication service for the purpose of self-training, intercommunication and technical investigations carried out by amateurs, that is, duly authorized persons interested in radio technique solely with a personal aim and without pecuniary interest. So, for that rule to apply, you need a device (an apparatus), that has to be used for self-training etc (read above), for noncommercial, personal aim by a licenced (&quot;duly authorized&quot;) person. Only then can you break other rules (eg power limits) in situations described in rule 403 you linked above. Without a licence, a radio is just a radio, eg. a business band radio (like many motorolas are), and nothing in the part 97 (regulating amateur radio) applies to the user of that radio. Only when a licenced ham uses that (or any other radio, or even a homemade transmitter), in a specific way (described above) that &quot;just-a-radio&quot; becomes an amateur station. reply nunobrito 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Again with FUD. In Portugal you are legally permitted to use channel 9 (27.065 MHz) in addition to the PMR channels. The hard line has always been on public safety bands. From a long time cooperation with the authorities (especially around the Azores) there was always an informal permission for that kind of usage across boats and islands because communication is difficult there. Last but not least: taking the radio license exam is NOT a drama. Anyone can apply and get the radio license when they are serious into this topic. reply ajsnigrutin 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] What fud? Channel 9 is a CB channel, and neither quanshengs nor baofengs work on those frequencies at all, but you need a certified&#x2F;type-accepted CB radio to use on that frequency. Same with PMR, you need a PMR radio to use on pmr frequencies. It&#x27;s not FUD, it&#x27;s just hardware limits and regulation. Yes, 12yo kids can get an amateur radio licence, it&#x27;s easy, but you still need a licence to transmit on ham bands, and you still cannot legally use a baofeng (except the few pmr models) or a quansheng on PMR frequencies, those radios don&#x27;t transmit on cb freqencies at all, and there are no legal &quot;you don&#x27;t need a licence in an emergency&quot; exceptions. reply harvey9 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I have a ham radio and still not got around to getting my license.

In most countries emergency services have moved over to tetra or dmr, with encryption, and all the public related info is broadcasted on &quot;normal&quot; broadcast fm, where you need a normal fm radio, not a ham transciever. reply nunobrito 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That is a question you can answer yourself when trying it out. In Portugal +90% of tetra stopped working. DMR only locally. Satellite APRS continued working. Who will listen? Well, those from north to south on the country were listening. More important, they were listening who was still active because those were the stations running with their own energy because even FM stations started to go down quickly as the generators ran out of fuel. Had the blackdown lasted a week, those with a 20 euros walkie-talkies would very likely be the only ones still capable of +50 km distance communications and +1700 km reach using satellite APRS text messages. Try to see from it from that perspective. You really won&#x27;t have electricity nor cellphone coverage and not even FM in such scenario..

In case of conflict, everyone who starts LoRa gets delivery of artillery shell&#x2F;rocket on their position. Just like in Ukraine, try to go there and start up stock firmware DJI drone there and see what happens :) Same when using radios in UA, no.1 rule is to NOT use encrypted radios, I like this example the most, because it goes against common sense, why would you want to use unencrypted radios so enemies can see your whole communication. Reason behind this is following, encrypted radio traffic is very interesting for enemy, so it means if someone using it, he must be someone important -&gt; send shell, badabum. reply looofooo0 9 hours ago | parent | next [–] If it is that easy to become an artillery target, you can use it to your advantage. Randomly place LoRa devices in area near the front (by autonomous or fiber optic drone drop to decrease risk).

But the wider point is generally that just because something is less effective doesn&#x27;t make it useless, and just because something is effective doesn&#x27;t make it dominating . If an enemy has an artillery advantage, then shelling obvious decoys is still taking decoys off the field, which you now need to replace. But worse, their existence is giving away the fact you&#x27;re active in the area, and their placement is giving away your operational range - i.e. how far can a person move on foot over rough terrain? How far in a vehicle? etc. What&#x27;s the effective range of their normal infantry weapons - if you know there&#x27;s a decoy then the trap has a specific radius if it is a trap. All on the bet that they will in fact run out of shells - or in the case of drones, they won&#x27;t even run out since a drone can much more easily be re-targeted. reply looofooo0 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Well you entering deep level of game theory here. Can you distinguish the decoy from the real and what resources you need to spend (e.g. LoRa device in a home)? How much is the signal that you can deploy decoys worth?

You can run LoRa from a small power bank for days, or run it off of a small battery and solar panel indefinitely. Wifi is much more power hungry. Wifi also doesn&#x27;t offer kilometres of range, making that power cost largely wasteful. In an emergency, if you have limited power, WiFi will exclude 100% of the population simply because it&#x27;s not practical to operate at all. LoRa, even if it enables 0.01% of the population (primarily experts in the technology) in that emergency, is a greater benefit to everyone at that time. WiFi is a peace time technology based around a rich infrastructure that is not resilient in emergencies. If you skimmed the article you should check it out again. She details this stuff, and it&#x27;s actually really interesting and worth understanding if you&#x27;re into this stuff: LoRa radios have several advantages for use in emergency communications: no centralized infrastructure needed no license needed cheap (starting at ~€20) low-power (&lt; 1W, can power with an ordinary mobile phone powerbank) runs open source Meshtastic firmware can send text messages across several line-of-sight hops (several kms) can connect via Bluetooth or WiFi to phones&#x2F;computers many urban areas have a good Meshtastic network already reply 7373737373 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] WiFi (with extra hardware, mostly antennas&#x2F;routers, not too expensive anymore either) CAN offer (even tens of) kilometers of range, at least point to point: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lYJFwXw1ZIc https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eu.store.ui.com&#x2F;eu&#x2F;en&#x2F;category&#x2F;wireless-ltu-5ghz&#x2F;pro... only 9W max power consumption too! well, that&#x27;s not a few hundred milliwatts, still, better then ye olde lightbulb PLUS gigabit throughput if only our network stacks and protocols didn&#x27;t assume hierarchical (local) networks by default, and kernels included p2p network stacks, then i&#x27;d feel more confident about blackouts being handled more gracefully well, i suppose all this depends heavily on the nature of the emergency generally i&#x27;m surprised that the sheer computational power of modern smartphones are not used more for this purpose, i haven&#x27;t come across much true p2p software on another note, there is still no (truly) cross-platform https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AirDrop standard (especially one without artificial limitations), which is a shame also i want to note that smartphones can even communicate directly with satellites now: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=v30z-0bGbHQ reply steve_adams_86 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, I use my phone over satellite regularly now. It&#x27;s still amazing to me that it&#x27;s possible. Phones are a great tool here because everyone truly does have them, they&#x27;re portable, and they have large rechargeable batteries that can charge from countless sources over USB. So, it does seem like we could use them to great effect to create networks when other systems go down. I&#x27;m not sure they can handle long range comms due to requiring antennas, but close-range in cities might work well. I&#x27;m not sure what routing on that mesh would look like, or how busy it would get and how well phones could handle that. Satellites could be an important component here, but there&#x27;s always the need for redundancy. They can be compromised too, and you don&#x27;t own them. The LTU Extreme Range hardware is way, way more expensive than a LoRa radio, and it still uses quite a bit of power (relatively). It still seems far from ideal in situations where you can&#x27;t depend on power utilities. Great point though, I wasn&#x27;t aware that exists.

(can&#x27;t absorb more than everything). If you add more CO2 you&#x27;ll start to absorb more in new frequencies, but the effect is getting smaller. To calculate how much the numbers add up, there is HITRAN-Database with a lot of data about the absorption lines. About these calculations there&#x27;s interesting material out there.

I think a few quotes from the article do a good job at summarizing who he was: &gt;These were not plays in any traditional sense. Instead, Foreman created living works of art by “using everything” that a given moment in time brought to bear on his process. He began not with a completed script but with a raw running text, the lines of which he would assign during his monthslong rehearsals, arranging and rearranging his words, giving them to one actor then trying them out on another. &gt;The visual style of his earliest works resembled that of the surrealists: he composed tidy, witty tableaux of odd objects and strange people speaking what often seemed like stray thoughts, all of which briefly shared the air before careening into their next encounter. Later, the look of his productions became more macabre, almost menacing: he would litter the stage with stuff, visual interferences that prompted the audience to lean closer and look harder. Throughout, his plays remained fairly consistent, all running about seventy minutes and keeping his performers in a near-constant state of movement as they spouted lines that sounded as though a mystic had fallen through the looking glass or a philosopher had become stuck in a screwball comedy. These mind-melting, incandescent productions were equal parts theater, philosophy, literature, and visual art. &gt;He wrote and directed at least one new play a year, designing the sets as well as the sound, which comprised densely layered loops and samples that he himself played live at every performance. &gt;Foreman was a MacArthur Fellow whose genius status did not prevent handfuls of people from leaving the theater at nearly every single one of his shows. Something the HN crowd can appreciate: he offered up his plays to the public, on his website ontological.com, free to stage or create new works or do what you wished.

Copyright © 1974 Babette Mangolte, all rights of reproduction reserved. The mind is a supple, ever-changing thing. This is a fact, not a flaw. For the theater artist Richard Foreman, who died this past January at age eighty-seven, the time of thinking, of writing, of creating was always now. And now. And now. In a 1926 essay called “ Composition as Explanation ,” Gertrude Stein wrote: “Continuous present is one thing and beginning again and again is another thing. These are both things. And then there is using everything.” As a young artist, Foreman picked up Stein’s idea and chose to stand in the slipstream of the present. He set aside middles and ends—too artificial, too confining—preferring for his plays to channel the sublime havoc of being. As he wrote in 1972: I want to be seized by the elusive, unexpected aliveness of the moment.… …surprised by a freshness of moment that eludes                                                                    constantly refreshes. Between 1968 and 2013, Foreman made more than fifty productions for the stage. These were not plays in any traditional sense. Instead, Foreman created living works of art by “using everything” that a given moment in time brought to bear on his process. He began not with a completed script but with a raw running text, the lines of which he would assign during his monthslong rehearsals, arranging and rearranging his words, giving them to one actor then trying them out on another. (The published collections of his works are more or less transcriptions of the live shows, including dialogue and direction.) He built and rebuilt his sets, props, and costumes every day in his theater space. Foreman’s aesthetic changed over the decades. The visual style of his earliest works resembled that of the surrealists: he composed tidy, witty tableaux of odd objects and strange people speaking what often seemed like stray thoughts, all of which briefly shared the air before careening into their next encounter. Later, the look of his productions became more macabre, almost menacing: he would litter the stage with stuff, visual interferences that prompted the audience to lean closer and look harder. Throughout, his plays remained fairly consistent, all running about seventy minutes and keeping his performers in a near-constant state of movement as they spouted lines that sounded as though a mystic had fallen through the looking glass or a philosopher had become stuck in a screwball comedy. These mind-melting, incandescent productions were equal parts theater, philosophy, literature, and visual art. They were also, by nature and by design, irreproducible, conceived as a different kind of cultural force. As Foreman described them in 1985: A reverberation machine! That’s what my plays are!…The plays are about whatever happens when I am in a certain way, functioning on a certain level (which gives me most delight) and I open to you in that delight, my joy wants to amuse you with the fact that things inevitably will connect, will reverberate with each other. The world is a reverberation machine , that’s what I show you! By the time Foreman died, he had figured out a way by which an artwork, and an artist, could remain in the present tense ad infinitum. born in 1937 , Foreman was adopted as a newborn by an affluent lawyer and his wife, who raised him and his younger sister in Scarsdale, New York. The suburb offered the boy almost none of the intellectual or cultural stimulation he craved, but it was only a short train ride to Manhattan, where he often sat in the audience for Broadway productions directed by the virtuosos of midcentury American realism, including Elia Kazan, Harold Clurman, and José Quintero. Foreman went to Brown University, where he made a name for himself as a gifted actor, and then earned an MFA in playwriting from the Yale School of Drama in 1962. Soon thereafter, he moved to New York City with his first wife, actress-turned-film-critic Amy Taubin, and quickly fell in step with the community of underground filmmakers and artists who orbited Jonas Mekas’s Film-Makers’ Cinematheque in SoHo, which gave a home to personal, lyrical films that often transgressed, or ignored, the usual conventions of cinema. Foreman had long harbored inklings of ideas for a new kind of theater, or at least a theater that felt like his own, one that would shake both artists and audiences out of the comforts of outdated forms and what he felt was their stunting reverence for realism. After all, if it is commonly agreed that theater is a space of fiction, then why in the name of all that is sane would anyone demand that a play behave like real life? He would later recall that Jack Smith’s fantastical, orgiastic film Flaming Creatures delivered one of the great revelations of his artistic evolution. A brazen, no-budget, unabashedly queer bacchanalia inspired by Hollywood B-movie exotica, Smith’s 1963 magnum opus was unlike anything Foreman had seen before. Introducing &quot;Back Matter&quot; A new Substack from The Yale Review , featuring writing prompts, editorial insights, archival finds, and more. Read More Downtown New York was then ground zero for the American avant-garde. The neighborhoods east to west below Fourteenth Street teemed with artists, writers, choreographers, dancers, composers, musicians, directors, and others who felt that art was not merely a profession but a way of being in the world, or of creating a new one entirely apart from the totalizing constraints of tradition. Foreman’s peers included the choreographers Yvonne Rainer and Trisha Brown, the filmmakers Mekas and Ken Jacobs, the theater artists Richard Schechner and Robert Wilson, the composer Meredith Monk, and, in the mid-1970s, Elizabeth LeCompte and the Wooster Group. When Foreman debuted his first play, Angelface , at Mekas’s Cinematheque in 1968 under the auspices of what would become his lifetime project, the Ontological-Hysteric Theater, he began by beginning again. He rejected realism’s predictable logics, and also the false promise of using chance operations, the modus operandi of the composer John Cage and the Fluxus group of artists. He felt that each strategy too readily fulfilled an audience’s expectations rather than suspending them in time, manipulated viewers’ emotions instead of sustaining them with an ongoing supply of fresh food for the mind. In Angelface , for which there is no extant documentation save the script, Foreman presented rather affectless characters who converse about straightforward subjects like the movement and direction of their bodies with as much zeal as if they were talking to themselves. As he noted in his “ Ontological-Hysteric Manifesto I ,” written in 1972: Art is not beauty of  description or depth of emotion, it is making a machine, not to do some- thing to audience, but that makes itself run on new fuel.… WE MAKE A PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE . (The closer to that ideal the better. Run on less and less fuel…that’s the goal of the new art machine.) The analogy of artist and machine recurs in Foreman’s early writings, conveying the spirit of creating over and again without pausing to question why. The job at hand—thinking, making, performing—is the job at hand. Foreman himself could indeed seem like a machine. He wrote and directed at least one new play a year, designing the sets as well as the sound, which comprised densely layered loops and samples that he himself played live at every performance. Most of his works were staged in his loft at 491 Broadway until 1992, when he moved the Ontological-Hysteric to a small black-box theater at St. Mark’s Church in-the-Bowery in the East Village. He made a feature film, Strong Medicine (1981), starring the artist-performer Kate Manheim, his muse and second wife, with whom he collaborated on a number of his productions. He wrote operas and directed works (his own, and those of others) for the Public Theater, Lincoln Center, Paris’s Festival d’Automne, Los Angeles’s REDCAT theater, and many other venues around the world. Foreman was a MacArthur Fellow whose genius status did not prevent handfuls of people from leaving the theater at nearly every single one of his shows. despite the machine metaphors , Foreman’s theater in fact worked as a container of consciousness. Like the human mind, subject to whim and distraction and desire, his plays were constantly interrupted, disturbed, even pushed to the brink of collapse. Foreman achieved this in part by using slapstick tricks: the lights would suddenly surge, or a deafening BANG would blast in through the speakers, or the actors would, on a dime, drop to the floor. No reasons given or allowed. He also made ingenious formal moves that were more nuanced, revealing their purpose over the duration of a show. He would hang strings across the stage, taut like lines drawn in the air, gently slicing into the room’s sight lines. A wall of plexiglass often stood at the foot of the stage, creating a fishbowl effect between the performers and the audience, though there was no telling who was in the drink and who was on dry land. At first sight, the plexi’s purpose seemed straightforward: here it was, the fourth wall made transparent. When Foreman’s actors would look at the audience, as they invariably did, the divide between stage and life was clearly maintained— here remained distinct from there —and yet all of us could see right through it. Then, when the lights would hit the wall’s surface just so, what the audience would see most vividly was its own reflection. What were his plays about? Some people refer to writing as a practice . For Foreman, it was a lifestyle, a condition, an action born of physical leisure and a wandering mind. A day’s work might go something like this: He would read (ravenously) and doze off, keeping a pen and notebook nearby. When words or thoughts or half-thoughts trickled through his consciousness, he wrote them down, resisting the desire to muscle them into sense. He would then arrange his jottings into a text that seemed to him ready for staging. He often began his rehearsals without a firm idea about which character would say which line. Aiming to create a total experience of theater, Foreman demoted story. Instead, he’d plunk down on the stage characters who had questions, conundrums, impossible asks, then surround them with other characters who might, or might not, have answers. Repeated throughout his work—the shape that recurred—was the circularity of the search, of endless seeking. Although his characters never seemed to get the answers they wanted, by the time the show was over, his audiences were too giddy, too overwhelmed, to recall what had been asked in the first place. Questions were important. Foreman’s plays sometimes began with a goofy one, as in My Head Was a Sledgehammer (1994): “Okay, Mr. Professor…are you as weird as I think you are?” Other times, Foreman launched a show with an equally goofy declaration. At the top of Film Is Evil: Radio Is Good (1990), for instance, Estelle says to Paul: “I have an announcement to make. You are not my Prince Charming.” Foreman’s productions could also be self-reflexive inquiries regarding the nature of theater, as in Eddie Goes to Poetry City, Part One (1990): “If this were a play, a curtain would be drawn. And the audience would be in darkness.” And as in Pearls for Pigs (1997): “I hate the actors who appear in this play.” A 1999 production cheekily announced in the first few minutes: “All audiences must now be informed that this play, Paradise Hotel , is not, in fact, Paradise Hotel , but is, in truth, a much more disturbing, and possibly illegal, play entitled—‘Hotel Fuck’!” one afternoon in the summer of 1995, I received a call out of the blue while I was at work. “Jennifer, this is Richard Foreman. I’m calling to see if you’d like to be in my next play.” It was called Permanent Brain Damage . No audition, just a yes or no. I said yes, told him it would be my honor. He explained that his producer at the time, Sophie Haviland, would be in touch soon with the details, then said goodbye and hung up. I think our conversation, such as it was, lasted less than a minute. I felt proud, excited, though I knew better than to feel flattered. Foreman had seen me in other plays at the Ontological-Hysteric, which Sophie had persuaded him to rent to young theater-makers when he himself wasn’t using it. There was no fooling myself into thinking that I’d gotten the job because of his high esteem for me as a performer, or his appreciation of any singular skills I may have had. I got the job because I, for reasons still unknown to me, fit his bill. (A year or so later, Foreman asked me to audition to replace the actress who originated the role of Columbine in Pearls for Pigs , which was about to go on tour. As soon as I’d finished reading—and I had done a pretty good job of it too, I thought—he explained that he couldn’t possibly hire me. I was too tall to fit inside the wooden box where Columbine had to hide at some point in the show, and there was no time to build a new one.) Foreman alone knew what his shows should be, and that knowledge only revealed itself in the process of their making. I do not recall him ever presenting a sum-total vision of Permanent Brain Damage at the outset of rehearsal. No speech about its story, its themes, or any theories he was testing. He made no case for the work’s relevance or urgency or necessity, as theater directors often will. Doing so would have capitulated to the insidious belief embedded in the psyches of most American artists: that all works of art must be created in their own defense. Foreman had no doubts regarding his work’s right to exist—a confidence that emboldened his performers and audiences alike to stride into these unbalancing territories, to see for themselves—though he doubted every second that his work was working . I saw our stage-size cosmos begin to hold together, to find its center by some rising force of gravity. During the grueling, invigorating weeks of rehearsal, the Ontological-Hysteric felt more like an artist’s studio than a theater. Foreman always arrived in the morning before we did to tinker with the set, lights, and sound, and after releasing us for the day, he would stay to keep on tinkering. He had apprentices who built props on the fly or quickly mended and tweaked things onstage. I recall him once telling one of them to go out and buy newspapers and scatter the pages across the stage floor. On another day, he sent everyone home early because he hated something about the set, couldn’t stand the sight of it—was the back wall too far back?—and needed to fix it before he could continue. Over time, compositions (my word, not his) took shape. Instead of feeling like an asteroid colliding into the other performers, I saw our stage-size cosmos begin to hold together, to find its center by some rising force of gravity. Foreman’s performers did not act in the traditional sense, serving instead as highly attuned instruments for the maestro. One of Foreman’s early influences was the great French filmmaker Robert Bresson, who referred to his actors as “models” and instructed them to repeat dialogue and actions until any whiff of theatricality, of self-consciousness, had dissipated. “What interested me,” Foreman wrote of his earliest productions, “was taking people from real life, nonactors, and putting them onstage to allow their real personalities to have a defiant impact on the conventional audience.” Eventually, that approach proved less interesting, and he realized he needed performers “whose skill enables the audience to look through them to see into the text itself.” In rehearsal, Foreman would have his cast repeat actions over and over again, which had the dual effect of dulling their nervous systems and pushing actions deeper into their bodies, transforming the actors into living conduits for his words. Whole afternoons might be spent on a thirty-second sequence, a week on a single scene. He wasn’t chasing an idea of perfection; he was writing the physical language of the play as it developed, move by move, which required time and testing. Like a hawk hunting a field mouse, he had an attention for details so minute as to seem absolutely inconsequential. He might say to a performer something like: Sit in that chair and look to your left. Then cup your knees with your hands and slowly point your left index finger to the right. From wherever he was in the theater, Foreman would then train his eyes on the actor and correct or revise the gesture. No, go slower. Straighten your finger. Again. Now point with two fingers. The seeking and polishing might take just a minute or two, but sometimes it went on for a long time, the rest of the cast perched around the stage, watching, drifting. In rehearsals, boredom could be a near-ecstatic experience. One’s sense of scale shifted and warped as that tiny disposable gesture suddenly seemed as though it were the key to this great unknown work unfolding around us. For an audience, whose attention was invariably drawn in multiple directions all at once, such detonations may have gone completely unnoticed. Being alive is a problem Because being alive is an exception To all other things. the contradiction that kept Foreman’s work combustible had to do with his relation to context. An artist so devoted to the passing moment also instructed his audiences to “resist the present.” As he elaborated in his 1992 collection of essays and scripts, Unbalancing Acts: Foundations for a Theater : “You want to remove the hypnotic power that the world currently has over you. Rather than be hypnotized by it, you want to be free of the world. You want to realize that the world you see is made by the way you see it.” In other words, for Foreman, the choice is yours: what you see is what you make. The true map of culture should be drawn like a bomb site or, more gently, like a stone dropped into water. At the center is the splash, from which the ripples radiate— reverberate . The wider their reach, the weaker the waves. The metaphor of the “mainstream” has always been faulty, if not altogether fatal, placing success stories at the center of the map—as determined by celebrity, money, broad appeal—and sidelining those artists, like Foreman, whose innovations are what made way for that success in the first place.

Subscribe Foreman never wished to be imitated or reproduced, but he did want to ensure that he and his work could continue to reverberate. To do so, in the late 1990s, he began uploading to the Ontological-Hysteric website hundreds upon hundreds of pages of the raw texts from which he crafted his plays over the years, offering his writing for anyone to use for any reason: to stage, to revise, to cut up, to create something Foreman himself couldn’t have imagined. “I ask no royalty,” he explained in a note, hoping this would eliminate any barrier to any potential colleagues. “Because of the unique way I generate plays—this may mean I myself will still be using from this pool of material in the future. I invite you to do so also.” With this seemingly simple gesture, Foreman made sure that his work could remain in the present, even without him. And that work is desperately needed. It is impossible to believe that the American mind is alive and thriving right now. Then again, belief, if not held lightly, can quickly become a palliative for one’s own lack of imagination. In the case of art and culture’s loss of life force, the depletion, which began long before 2016, can be traced beyond politics, self, and wealth to the disappearance of a rigorous, fortifying avant-garde. What does it mean to be avant-garde? Experimental? To think about the world while thinking apart from it, creating not merely in resistance to its seductions and limitations, formal and otherwise, but free of them? Is it an ethos or a tradition? Yes and yes, although what complicates the sustaining of an avant-garde is its ambivalence toward legacy, something institutions seem to yearn for more than artists do themselves. In the spirit of the innovative, the inimitable, a gauntlet is dropped, surely to be picked up but not to inspire a line of gloves just like it. Last autumn, I received a copy of a manuscript of Foreman’s unpublished works, which the poet Charles Bernstein was helping to edit when the artist passed away. In its pages, I read: I have an unquenchable hunger for true statements about what it is to exist (to exist is to- ) THE TRAP of existing. Until the end, it seems, he was continuously beginning again. The last quotation, from an unpublished manuscript by Richard Foreman, is used with the permission of the Richard Foreman Literary Trust.

With traditional control methods facing mounting resistance, researchers are seeking innovative ways to combat mosquito-borne disease. Now, entomologists at the University of Maryland have bioengineered a deadly fungus that spreads sexually in Anopheles (malaria-spreading) mosquitoes. The naturally occurring fungus called Metarhizium produces insect-specific neurotoxins, potent enough to kill female mosquitoes – the ones that spread disease. By dusting male mosquitoes with modified fungal spores, the team essentially created a sexually transmitted infection for mosquitoes. For reference, this is not the first time that scientists have exploited mosquito mating habits to curb populations. Recently, researchers modified male mosquitoes to secrete toxic proteins in their semen , to kill female mosquitoes after mating. While Metarhizium was already known to transmit through sex, natural strains resulted in very low mortality. In field trials conducted in Burkina Faso, West Africa, the newly engineered version proved far more lethal; nearly 90% of females died within two weeks of mating with infected males, compared to just a 4% mortality rate with wild-type Metarhizium . Notably, the fungal infection did not deter female mosquitoes from mating with infected males. Despite being lethal to mosquitoes, the transgenic Metarhizium fungus is harmless in humans. Once exposed, male mosquitoes with the fungal strain can transmit spores for up to 24 hours to multiple mating partners, making the method ideal to deploy in the environment. “What makes this fungus particularly promising is that it works with existing mosquito behavior rather than against their natural habits," says study co-author Raymond St. Leger. "Unlike pesticides or other chemical control methods that mosquitoes can develop resistance to, this method uses the mosquitoes’ own biology to deliver the control agent." But why are such approaches necessary? Primarily, it's due to the mosquito’s remarkable adaptability. Recently, mosquitoes and mosquito-borne parasites have developed resistance to chemical treatments and antimalarial drugs. Some mosquito populations have even adapted by avoiding bed nets and repellents, choosing instead to rest outdoors. “It’s essentially an arms race between the mosquitoes and us," says St. Leger. "Just as they keep adapting to what we create, we have to continuously develop new and creative ways to fight them,” The study was published in Scientific Reports .

Specifically: SSLv2 was the first widely deployed version of SSL, but as this post indicates, had a number of issues. SSLv3 is a more or less completely new protocol TLS 1.0 is much like SSLv3 but with some small revisions made during the IETF standardization process. TLS 1.1 is a really minor revision to TLS 1.0 to address some issues with the way block ciphers were used. TLS 1.2 is a moderately sized revision to TLS 1.1 to adjust to advances in cryptography, specifically adding support for newer hashes in response to weaknesses in MD5 and SHA-1 and adding support for AEAD cipher suites such as AES-GCM. TLS 1.3 is mostly a new protocol though it reuses some pieces of TLS 1.2 and before. Each of these protocols has been designed so that you could automatically negotiate versions, thus allowing for clients and servers to independently upgrade without loss of connectivity. reply nextgens 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] TLS1.0 introduced modularity via the concept of &quot;extensions&quot;. It&#x27;s everything but a minor evolution of the protocol. One of the many things it brought is session tickets, enabling server-side session resumption without requiring servers to keep synced-up state. Another is Server Name Indication, enabling servers to use more than one certificate. reply ekr____ 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] FWIW, these aren&#x27;t actually in TLS 1.0. Extensions (including SNI) are in later spec but introduces in RFC 3546 ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc3546 ). Session tickets are in RFC 4507. What TLS 1.0 did was to leave the door open for extensions by allowing the ClientHello to be longer than what was specified.

And ensuring decades of various downgrade attacks reply mcpherrinm 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The downgrade attacks on TLS are only really present in the case of client behaviour where, on failing to achieve one version, they retry a new connection without it. This was necessary to bypass various broken server side implementations, and broken middleboxes, but wasn’t necessarily a flaw in TLS itself. But from the learnings of this issue preventing 1.2 deployment, TLS 1.3 goes out of its way to look very similar on the wire to 1.2 reply matthewdgreen 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This isn&#x27;t really accurate historically. TLS has both ciphersuite and version negotiation. Logjam (2015) [1] was a downgrade attack on the former that&#x27;s now fixed, but is an extension of an attack that was first noticed way back in 1996 [2]. Similar problems occurred with the FREAK attack, though that was actually a client vulnerability. TLS 1.3 goes out of its way to fix all of this using a better negotiation mechanism, and by reducing agility.

If you don&#x27;t have this kind of automatic version negotiation then it&#x27;s essentially impossible to deploy a new version. reply upofadown 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Well you can , but that would require a higher level of political skill than normally exists for such things. What would have to happen is that almost everyone would have to agree on the new version and then implement it. Once implementation was sufficiently high enough then you have a switchover day. The big risk with such an approach is that you could implement something, then the politics could fail and you would end up with nothing. The big downside of negotiation is that no one ever has to commit to anything so everything is possible. In the case of TLS, that seems to have led to endless bikeshedding which has created a standard which has so many options is is hardly a standard anymore. The only part that has to be truly standard is the negotiation scheme. reply ekr____ 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This seems like a truly unreasonable level of political skill for nearly any setting. We&#x27;re talking about changing every endpoint in the Internet, including those which can no longer be upgraded. I struggle to think of any entity or set of entities which could plausibly do that. Moreover, even in the best case scenario this means that you don&#x27;t get the benefits of deployment for years if not decades. Even 7 years out, TLS 1.3 is well below 100% deployment. To take a specific example here: we want to deploy PQ ciphers ASAP to prevent harvest-and-decrypt attacks. Why should this wait for 100% deployment? &gt; The big downside of negotiation is that no one ever has to commit to anything so everything is possible.

The only part that has to be truly standard is the negotiation scheme. I don&#x27;t think this is really that accurate, especially on the Web. The actual widely in use options are fairly narrow. TLS is used in a lot of different settings, so it&#x27;s unsurprising that there are a lot of options to cover those settings. TLS 1.3 did manage to reduce those quite a bit, however. reply Sophira 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; This seems like a truly unreasonable level of political skill for nearly any setting.

The last time the internet went through such a change was January 1, 1983, when the ARPANET switched from NCP to the newly designed TCP&#x2F;IP. People want to do something similar on February 1, 2030, to remove IPv4 and switch totally to IPv6, but I give it a 50&#x2F;50 chance of success, and IPv6 is already about 30 years old. See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipv4flagday.net&#x2F; reply upofadown 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You don&#x27;t have to have everyone switch over on the same day as with your example. Once it is decreed that implementations are widespread enough, then everyone can switch over to the introduced thing gradually. The &quot;flag day&quot; is when it is decreed that implementations no longer have to support some previously widely used method. Support for that method would then gradually disappear unless there was some associated cryptographic emergency that could not be dealt with without changing the standard. reply ekr____ 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Well, this is basically what we do, except that we try to negotiate to the highest version during the period before the flag day. This is far more practical for three reasons: 1. You actually get benefit during the transition period because you get to use the new version. 2. You get to test the new version at scale, which often reveals issues, as it did with TLS 1.3. It also makes it much easier to measure deployment because you can see what is actually negotiated. 3. Generally, implementations are very risk averse and so aren&#x27;t willing to disable older versions until there is basically universal deployment, so it takes the pressure off of this decision. reply freeone3000 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; The big risk with such an approach is that you could implement something, then the politics could fail and you would end up with nothing.

However, the reason to treat them distinctly (as different origins, technically) is that HTTPS provides integrity whereas HTTP does not. So, consider the case where the client enters an HTTP URL and is redirected, just as you say above. If the attacker injects their own JS and it is cached in an origin that is just `example.com`, then they control the user&#x27;s experience of the site, even if later the user securely goes to the site with HTTPS. reply dotancohen 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Thank you.

Sure it&#x27;d be a tiny bit more overhead for servers, but no different than what we already experienced moving away from unencrypted http reply ekr____ 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This has a number of negative downstream effects. First, recall that links are very often inter-site, so the consequence would be that even when a server upgraded to TLS 1.2, clients would still try to connect with TLS 1.1 because they were using the wrong kind of link. This would relay delay deployment. By contrast, today when the server upgrades then new clients upgrade as well. Second, in the Web security model, the Origin of a resource (e.g., the context in which the JS runs) is based on scheme&#x2F;host&#x2F;port. So httpt would be a different origin from HTTPS. Consider what happens if the incoming link is https and internal links are httpt now different pages are different origins for the same site. These considerations are so important that when QUIC was developed, the IETF decided that QUIC would also be an https URL (it helps that IETF QUIC&#x27;s cryptographic handshake is TLS 1.3). reply tgma 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] TLS is one of the best success stories of widely applied security with great UX.

The TLS 1.3 anti-downgrade feature was not compatible with some popular middlebox products. Google told people too bad, either your vendor fixes it (most shipped free bug fixes for this issue, presumably &quot;encouraged&quot; by the resulting customer anger) or you can&#x27;t run Chrome once this temporary fudge goes away in a year&#x27;s time. Previously (in earlier protocol versions) nobody stood up to the crap middleboxes even though it&#x27;s bad for all normal users. reply drob518 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The service providers were the worst offenders here because they wanted to be the MIM to be able to look at the data and “add value” to their networks some how.

Could you expand a bit here? Do you just mean how extensions to the protocol are handled, etc., or the overall process and involved parties? reply frollogaston 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] XMPP is too loose. Easiest comparison is security alone. XMPP auth and encryption are complicated, and they&#x27;re optional for each of c2s, s2c, s2s (setting aside e2e). Clients and servers will quietly do the wrong thing if not configured exactly right. Email has similar problems, so bad that entire companies exist just to help set up stuff like DMARC, but that&#x27;s a simpler app than instant messaging. The rest of the XMPP feature set is also super loose. Clients and servers never agree on what extensions to implement, even for very basic things like chat rooms. I really tried to like it before giving up. Edit: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.xmpp.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;Securing_XMPP SSL is appropriately strict. Auth and encryption, both c2s and s2c, go together. They were a bit lax on upgrades in the past, but as another comment said, Google just said you fix your stuff or else Chrome will show a very scary banner on your website. Yes you can skip it or force special things like auth without encryption, but it&#x27;s impossible to do by accident. reply meepmorp 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] thanks for taking the time to respond! reply sjducb 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Man in the middle interfering with TLS handshakes? The handshake is unencrypted so you can modify the messages to make it look like the server only supports broken ciphers. Then the man in the middle can read all of the encrypted data because it was badly encrypted. A surprising number of servers still support broken ciphers due to legacy uses or incompetence. reply ekr____ 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, this is a seriously difficult problem with only partial solutions. The basic math of any kind of negotiation is that you need the minimum set of cryptographic parameters supported by both sides to be secure enough to resist downgrade. This is too small a space to support a complete accounting of the situation, but roughly: - In pre-TLS 1.3 versions of TLS, the Finished message was intended to provide secure negotiation as long as the weakest joint key exchange was secure, even if the weakest joint record protection algorithm was insecure, because the Finished provides integrity for the handshake outside of the record layer. - In TLS 1.3, the negotiation messages are also signed by the server, which is intended to protect negotiation as long as the weakest joint signature algorithm is secure. This is (I believe) the best you can do with a client and server which have never talked to each other, because if the signature algorithm is insecure, the attacker can just impersonate the server directly. - TLS 1.3 also includes a mechanism intended to prevent against TLS 1.3 -&gt; TLS 1.2 downgrade as long as the TLS 1.2 cipher suite involves server signing (as a practical matter, this means ECDHE). Briefly, the idea is to use a sentinel value in the random nonces, which are signed even in TLS 1.2 ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc8446#section-4.1.3 ). reply mcpherrinm 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] No: while the handshake is unencrypted, it is authenticated. An attacker can’t modify it. What an attacker can do is block handshakes with parameters they don’t like. Some clients would retry a new handshake with an older TLS version, because they’d take the silence to mean that the server has broken negotiation. reply mcpherrinm 52 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] well, unless both client and server have sufficiently weak crypto enabled that an attacker can break it during the handshake. Then you can MITM, force both sides to use the weak crypto, which can be broken, and you&#x27;re in the middle. Also not really so relevant today. reply kevincox 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You could encrypt the handshake that you recieved with the server&#x27;s certificate and send it back. Then if it doesn&#x27;t match what the server thought it sent it aborts the handshake. As long as the server&#x27;s cert isn&#x27;t broken this would detect a munged handshake, and if the server&#x27;s cert is broken you have no root of trust to start the connection in the first place. reply sjducb 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] How do you agree a protocol to encrypt the message to agree the protocol? This is the message that returns a list of supported ciphers and key exchange protocols. There’s no data in this first packet. Alice: I’d like to connect Bob: Sure here is a list of protocols we could use: You modify bob’s message so that bob only suggests insecure protocols. You might be proposing that Alice asks Trent for Bob’s public key … But that’s not how TLS works. reply lxgr 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Bob&#x27;s list of supported protocols is an input into the (authenticated) final handshake message, and that authentication failing will prevent the connection from being considered successfully established. If the &quot;negotiated&quot; cipher suite is weak enough to allow real-time impersonation of Bob, though, pre-1.3 versions are still vulnerable; that&#x27;s another reason not to keep insecure cipher suites around in a TLS config. reply dotancohen 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The fine man in the middle could still intercept that. reply jackgavigan 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It also enabled cipher strength &quot;step up&quot;. Back during the &#x27;90s and early 2000s (I&#x27;m not sure when it stopped, tbh), the US government restricted the export of strong cryptography, with certain exceptions (e.g. for financial services). If you fell under one of those exceptions, you could get a special certificate for your website (from, e.g. Verisign) that allowed the webserver to &quot;step up&quot; the encryption negotiation with the browser to stronger algorithms and&#x2F;or key lengths. reply da_chicken 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] They still should have just called it TLS v4.0 instead of v1.0.

No, Java applets failed because they became the poster child for &quot;Java is slow&quot; take. Even though it wasn&#x27;t exactly true in general, it was certainly true of applets, what with waiting for them to download and then waiting for the JVM to spin up.

It turns out it&#x27;s much more straightforward to sandbox the whole VM. A representative vulnerability is &quot;trusted method chaining&quot;. You (the attacker) construct a chain of standard library objects that call each other in unexpected ways. You can make use of the fact that you can subclass a standard library class and implement a standard library interface, in order to implement the interface methods with the base class&#x27;s implementations, to construct more unusual pathways. Then you get some standard library entry point to call the first method in the chain. Since your code doesn&#x27;t appear on the call stack at any point (it&#x27;s just the standard library calling the standard library) whatever is at the bottom of the call stack, at the end of the chain, infers a trusted context and can access files or whatever.

I recall a couple of occasions where people were talking about UCSPI-SSL and someone stepped in to explain that We Don&#x27;t Do SSL Now. As the headlined article says, that contrived distinction seems silly with the hindsight of decades. The nomenclature was complicated in people&#x27;s minds by SMTP. Because there was SMTP over a largely transparent encrypted connection, and SMTP where it started unencrypted and negotiated a switch, as well as plain old cleartext. It didn&#x27;t help that RFC 2487 explained that STARTTLS negotiated &quot;TLS more commonly known as SSL&quot;. RFC 8314 explains some of the historical mess that SMTP got into with two types of SMTP (relay and submission) and three types of transport. And the &quot;S&quot; for &quot;submission&quot; could be confused with the &quot;S&quot;s in both &quot;SSL&quot; and &quot;TLS&quot;. It&#x27;s not just TLAs that are ambiguous, indeed. There was confusion over &quot;SMTPS&quot; and &quot;SSMTP&quot;, not helped at all by the people who named programs things like &quot;sSMTP&quot;. I&#x27;m still calling it SSL in 2025.

They&#x27;re names of specific protocols with specific capabilities and versions. &quot;SSL 1.0&quot; and &quot;TLS 1.0&quot; are very different. (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;compare&#x2F;the-difference-between-ssl-an... ) The important bits: - &quot;SSL&quot; is a set of protocols so ridiculously old, busted and insecure that nobody should ever use them. It&#x27;s like talking about Sanskrit; ancient and dead. - &quot;TLS&quot; is way better than &quot;SSL&quot;, but still there are insecure versions. Any version before 1.2 is no longer supported due to security holes. - Technically an &quot;ssl certificate&quot; is neither &quot;SSL&quot; nor &quot;TLS&quot;, it&#x27;s really an &quot;X.509 Certificate with Extended Key Usage: Server Authentication&quot;. But that doesn&#x27;t roll off the tongue. You could use a cert from 1996 in a modern TLS server; the problem would be its expiration date, and the hash&#x2F;signature functions used back then are deprecated. (some servers still support insecure methods to support older clients, which is bad) reply creatonez 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The point is more that SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 were nearly identical. That is, the breaks in similarity were at SSL 2.0 -&gt; SSL 3.0 (and TLS 1.2 -&gt; TLS 1.3, to a lesser extent), as opposed to the common misconception that TLS 1.0 is what changed everything. But yes, it&#x27;s all a bit irrelevant now that anything below TLS 1.2 is sketchy to use. reply MOARDONGZPLZ 22 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Right, but they accomplish the same thing and people move monotonically from SSL to TLS.

I also like to say “TLS”. Two Ses in a row makes you sound like a snake. reply o11c 23 hours ago | parent | next [–] The problem is that TLS was already in widespread use for &quot;thread local storage&quot;. Transport Layer Security is widely documented as beginning in 1999. I can find references to &quot;Thread Local Storage&quot; going back to at least 1996. That particular term seems more common in the Microsoft (and maybe IBM, does anyone have an OS&#x2F;2 programming manual?) world at the time; Pthreads (1995) and Unix in general tended to call it &quot;thread-specific data&quot;. It&#x27;s possible that the highly influential 2001 Itanium ABI document (which directly led to Drepper&#x27;s TLS paper) brought the term to (widespread) use in the broader Unix world, though Sun (for both Solaris and Java?) was using the term previously. But it&#x27;s also possible that I&#x27;m just missing the reference material. reply kstrauser 23 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don’t doubt that, but I never heard Thread Local Storage until much later than that.

TlsAlloc() et al. were in the Win32 API right from NT 3.1, I think. reply dboreham 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] tls meaning thread local storage goes back at least to 1992 when Win32 was released. pthreads and Java are obviously much later. reply jeroenhd 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [–] I think SSL is a better fit, actually. In theory TLS could be a transport-layer security mechanism that would let arbitrary protocols run on top of it (like IPSec does), but in practice it&#x27;s pretty much tied up to TCP sockets. The UDP variant (DTLS, and I suppose QUIC) isn&#x27;t part of the TLS spec for instance. Of course we have kernel TLS on Linux now, and Windows also has infrastructure like that, but it isn&#x27;t as easy as setting a flag on a socket to turn TLS on. Plus, who doesn&#x27;t like to sound like a snake sometimes? Snakes are badass. reply somat 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Speaking of ipsec, ipsec was supposed to be &quot;the&quot; encrypted interchange on the internet, basically used for random secure connections like we use tls today. I like to imagine an alternate past where ipsec &quot;won&quot; and how that would affect our expectations of secure connections. One thing different is that the security would handled at the os level instead of the application level, on the one hand this is nice all application get a secure connection whether they want one or not, on the other hand the application has no idea it is using a secure transport and has no way of indicating this to the user. Anyhow the opportunistic connection employment of ipsec never really got implemented and all we use it for anymore is as a dedicated tunnel. one that is fiendishly difficult to employ. I think the primary problem with ipsec is that it tried to be too flexible. this made setting up a ipsec link a non-trivial exercise in communication, and the process never got streamlined enough to just be invisible and work. reply LukeShu 22 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] No? The &quot;transport&quot; layer is layer 4 in the 7-layer OSI model (physical&#x2F;datalink&#x2F;network&#x2F;transport&#x2F;session&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;application) and 5-layer IP model (physical&#x2F;network&#x2F;internetwork&#x2F;transport&#x2F;application). That is: the &quot;transport&quot; provides reliable continuous data-stream abstraction over the lower-layers&#x27; discreet and unreliable packets; e.g. TCP. And that data-stream the interface that TLS provides; to the higher layers it looks like a transport layer. reply aoetalks 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I was about to agree with you, and then I read the article on DTLS. &gt; And that data-stream the interface that TLS provides That’s exactly the problem.

You don&#x27;t do this in TLS (as opposed to DTLS) because it runs over TCP and therefore you are guaranteed in-order delivery. DTLS, by contrast, provides a record number hint (the low order bits of the record number and epoch) to assist in record number reconstruction: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc9147.html#name-reconstruct... . reply frollogaston 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The best name is, whatever was first and stuck. reply layer8 22 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] “SSL” is easier to pronounce, because the tongue barely changes position between the three letters, compared to “TLS”. reply nulbyte 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This is objective, but ai find TLS rolls more easily off the tongue. reply andrewfromx 23 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] picture kaa from the jungle book discussing tcp security and arguing for the s-s-l name.

The code above is part of a system I wrote that extracts detailed certificate information from HTTPS connections, and man was it ever a hassle to wrestle all the information I was interested in out of the java standard library. Sure on the one hand it&#x27;s easier to not mess up if it&#x27;s all automatic and out of sight, but at the same time, it&#x27;s not exactly beneficial to the spread of deeper awareness of how TLS actually works when it&#x27;s always such a black box. reply israrkhan 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I think most people call it SSL because they use OpenSSL library to deal with secure communication have SSL in their names.

The article makes it seems that just a couple of things were tweaked just to make it different for the sake of being different. reply timdierks 53 minutes ago | parent | next [–] The tweaks were minor (smaller than for any other version revision), and mostly just the IETF marking its territory and doing something other than blessing the SSL 3.0 protocol as-is. reply mcpherrinm 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The main difference is in the padding. When the POODLE attack was pre-announced as only affecting SSL3 and not TLS1.0, that was enough to predict it was going to be a padding oracle. I think it’s fair to say they’re very similar, with a few “bug fixes”. It’s been a while since I’ve thought about either though, and might be forgetting a few things. I’ve only ever implemented SSL3 and TLS1.0 together, so there may be some details I’m forgetting. reply nextgens 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] TLS1.0 introduced modularity via the concept of &quot;extensions&quot;.

I remember this moment and this is where I realized that Microsoft wasn&#x27;t always the bad guy here. They had the better implementation and were willing to share it. But Netscape in this instance acted like kids and wouldn&#x27;t cooperate at all. Which is why this meeting had to occur and by that point it was clear Netscape had lost the browser and it wasn&#x27;t going to be close. Hence the quick about face by Netscape to accept what was pretty much Microsoft&#x27;s proposed solution. I can&#x27;t speak to the rest of Microsoft&#x27;s browser decisions and given the court ruling it&#x27;s clear they weren&#x27;t the good guys either but this opened my eyes to the fact that all companies are the bad guys some time:) reply thayne 23 hours ago | parent | next [–] Forcing the name to be chnaged from SSL to TLS seems pretty petty to me.

They were pretty actively evil, not just &quot;closed source&quot;.

It’s easy to retroactively view Netscape’s resistance as petty, but the power imbalance was real, and the fear of Microsoft co-opting the standard wasn’t paranoia. Some companies make abuse a business model. I don&#x27;t see how anyone can defend a position where they only look at isolated actions of a company and not their overall strategic positioning. There are boundaries. Ethical boundaries. If you never experience the consequences of your actions, if nobody ever objects to your behavior, you will not stop. Especially not a distributed organism of a company, which has no inherent ethical boundaries; its boundaries are those that affect business, so you need to teach them in business. If your business model is based on treating your own employees like slaves, it is you who is cancer, not the other. Calling that “kid-like behavior” is misguided on two levels. First, as noted, Netscape’s actions were arguably rational in context - pushing back against a powerful incumbent trying to steer an open standard toward a proprietary implementation. Second, the phrase itself leans on a dismissive and inaccurate stereotype. Kids aren’t inherently irrational or overly emotional; in fact, there’s substantial research showing that young people behave quite logically given their environment. Framing behavior this way isn’t just lazy; it reinforces the kind of condescension that later gets labeled as “adverse childhood experiences” in therapy, assuming someone even gets the chance to unpack and not replicate it. On both levels, it is DARVO. reply Consider applying for YC's Fall 2025 batch!

They really had it out for each other. Netscape had developed the SSL protocol. The initial version had cryptographic flaws and was broken pretty quickly, and never released. The first production version was SSL 2, which was in use for a few years. (I don't know the exact versions of Navigator it shipped in.) SSL 2 had some flaws, both cryptographic and practical; not dramatic enough to make replacing it a crisis, but it clearly needed some work from early on. As a part of the cutthroat competition, Microsoft decided to revise the SSL 2 protocol with some additions of their own, and specified a protocol called "PCT" that was derived from SSL 2. It was only supported in IE and IIS. Netscape also wanted to address SSL 2 issues, but wasn't going to let Microsoft take leadership/ownership in the standard, so they developed SSL 3.0, which was a more significant departure. Various people in the industry & community didn't want a fork, so we (Consensus Development, where I worked with Christopher Allen at the time, and where I had written the SSL 3.0 reference implementation under contract to Netscape) hosted a meeting between representatives from Netscape and Microsoft; I forget everyone who was there, but I recall that Bruce Schneier was there (before he was famous), and probably Paul Kocher , who had designed the SSL 3 protocol; Barbara Fox represented Microsoft. And we negotiated a deal where Microsoft and Netscape would both support the IETF taking over the protocol and standardizing it in an open process, which led to me editing the RFC. As a part of the horsetrading, we had to make some changes to SSL 3.0 (so it wouldn't look the IETF was just rubberstamping Netscape's protocol), and we had to rename the protocol (for the same reason). And thus was born TLS 1.0 (which was really SSL 3.1). And of course, now, in retrospect, the whole thing looks silly. &#160; 4 comments: Yuhong Bao said... SSLv2 shipped in Netscape 1.1 in 1995.

Specifically: SSLv2 was the first widely deployed version of SSL, but as this post indicates, had a number of issues. SSLv3 is a more or less completely new protocol TLS 1.0 is much like SSLv3 but with some small revisions made during the IETF standardization process. TLS 1.1 is a really minor revision to TLS 1.0 to address some issues with the way block ciphers were used. TLS 1.2 is a moderately sized revision to TLS 1.1 to adjust to advances in cryptography, specifically adding support for newer hashes in response to weaknesses in MD5 and SHA-1 and adding support for AEAD cipher suites such as AES-GCM. TLS 1.3 is mostly a new protocol though it reuses some pieces of TLS 1.2 and before. Each of these protocols has been designed so that you could automatically negotiate versions, thus allowing for clients and servers to independently upgrade without loss of connectivity. reply nextgens 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] TLS1.0 introduced modularity via the concept of &quot;extensions&quot;. It&#x27;s everything but a minor evolution of the protocol. One of the many things it brought is session tickets, enabling server-side session resumption without requiring servers to keep synced-up state. Another is Server Name Indication, enabling servers to use more than one certificate. reply ekr____ 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] FWIW, these aren&#x27;t actually in TLS 1.0. Extensions (including SNI) are in later spec but introduces in RFC 3546 ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc3546 ). Session tickets are in RFC 4507. What TLS 1.0 did was to leave the door open for extensions by allowing the ClientHello to be longer than what was specified. See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc2246.html#section-7.4.1.2 (scroll to &quot;Forward Compatibility Note&quot;) reply cortesoft 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; Each of these protocols has been designed so that you could automatically negotiate versions, thus allowing for clients and servers to independently upgrade without loss of connectivity. And ensuring decades of various downgrade attacks reply mcpherrinm 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The downgrade attacks on TLS are only really present in the case of client behaviour where, on failing to achieve one version, they retry a new connection without it. This was necessary to bypass various broken server side implementations, and broken middleboxes, but wasn’t necessarily a flaw in TLS itself. But from the learnings of this issue preventing 1.2 deployment, TLS 1.3 goes out of its way to look very similar on the wire to 1.2 reply matthewdgreen 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This isn&#x27;t really accurate historically. TLS has both ciphersuite and version negotiation. Logjam (2015) [1] was a downgrade attack on the former that&#x27;s now fixed, but is an extension of an attack that was first noticed way back in 1996 [2]. Similar problems occurred with the FREAK attack, though that was actually a client vulnerability. TLS 1.3 goes out of its way to fix all of this using a better negotiation mechanism, and by reducing agility. [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Logjam_(computer_security) [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;legacy&#x2F;publications&#x2F;library&#x2F;proceedin... reply ekr____ 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Moreover, there&#x27;s not really much in the way of choices here. If you don&#x27;t have this kind of automatic version negotiation then it&#x27;s essentially impossible to deploy a new version. reply upofadown 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Well you can , but that would require a higher level of political skill than normally exists for such things. What would have to happen is that almost everyone would have to agree on the new version and then implement it. Once implementation was sufficiently high enough then you have a switchover day. The big risk with such an approach is that you could implement something, then the politics could fail and you would end up with nothing. The big downside of negotiation is that no one ever has to commit to anything so everything is possible. In the case of TLS, that seems to have led to endless bikeshedding which has created a standard which has so many options is is hardly a standard anymore. The only part that has to be truly standard is the negotiation scheme. reply ekr____ 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This seems like a truly unreasonable level of political skill for nearly any setting. We&#x27;re talking about changing every endpoint in the Internet, including those which can no longer be upgraded. I struggle to think of any entity or set of entities which could plausibly do that. Moreover, even in the best case scenario this means that you don&#x27;t get the benefits of deployment for years if not decades. Even 7 years out, TLS 1.3 is well below 100% deployment. To take a specific example here: we want to deploy PQ ciphers ASAP to prevent harvest-and-decrypt attacks. Why should this wait for 100% deployment? &gt; The big downside of negotiation is that no one ever has to commit to anything so everything is possible. In the case of TLS, that seems to have led to endless bikeshedding which has created a standard which has so many options is is hardly a standard anymore. The only part that has to be truly standard is the negotiation scheme. I don&#x27;t think this is really that accurate, especially on the Web. The actual widely in use options are fairly narrow. TLS is used in a lot of different settings, so it&#x27;s unsurprising that there are a lot of options to cover those settings. TLS 1.3 did manage to reduce those quite a bit, however. reply Sophira 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; This seems like a truly unreasonable level of political skill for nearly any setting. We&#x27;re talking about changing every endpoint in the Internet, including those which can no longer be upgraded. I struggle to think of any entity or set of entities which could plausibly do that. Case in point: IPv6 adoption. There&#x27;s no interoperability or negotiation between it and IPv4 (at least, not in any way that matters), which has led to the mess we&#x27;re in today. reply vladvasiliu 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Many servers and clients support both ipv4 and ipv6. So, in a sense, there&#x27;s a &quot;negotiation&quot; happening between client and server. reply happyopossum 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That’s not negotiating- I can’t connect to a server over v4 and have it tell me to switch to v6 or vice versa. That’s just supporting 2 completely different protocols. reply drob518 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That’s a great theory but in practice such a “flag day” almost never happens. The last time the internet went through such a change was January 1, 1983, when the ARPANET switched from NCP to the newly designed TCP&#x2F;IP. People want to do something similar on February 1, 2030, to remove IPv4 and switch totally to IPv6, but I give it a 50&#x2F;50 chance of success, and IPv6 is already about 30 years old. See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipv4flagday.net&#x2F; reply upofadown 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You don&#x27;t have to have everyone switch over on the same day as with your example. Once it is decreed that implementations are widespread enough, then everyone can switch over to the introduced thing gradually. The &quot;flag day&quot; is when it is decreed that implementations no longer have to support some previously widely used method. Support for that method would then gradually disappear unless there was some associated cryptographic emergency that could not be dealt with without changing the standard. reply ekr____ 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Well, this is basically what we do, except that we try to negotiate to the highest version during the period before the flag day. This is far more practical for three reasons: 1. You actually get benefit during the transition period because you get to use the new version. 2. You get to test the new version at scale, which often reveals issues, as it did with TLS 1.3. It also makes it much easier to measure deployment because you can see what is actually negotiated. 3. Generally, implementations are very risk averse and so aren&#x27;t willing to disable older versions until there is basically universal deployment, so it takes the pressure off of this decision. reply freeone3000 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; The big risk with such an approach is that you could implement something, then the politics could fail and you would end up with nothing. They learned the lesson of IPv6 here. reply thayne 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; that seems to have led to endless bikeshedding which has created a standard which has so many options is is hardly a standard anymore Part of the motivation of TLS 1.3 was to mitigate that. It removed a lot of options for negotiating the ciphersuite. reply pcthrowaway 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You could deploy a new version, you&#x27;d just have older clients unable to connect to servers implementing the newer versions. It wouldn&#x27;t have been insane to rename https to httpt or something after TLS 1.2 and screw backwards compatibility (yes I realize the &#x27;s&#x27; stands for secure, not &#x27;ssl&#x27;, but httpt would have still worked as &quot;HTTP with TLS&quot;) reply josephg 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; It wouldn&#x27;t have been insane to rename https to httpt or something after TLS 1.2 and screw backwards compatibility That would have been at least little bit insane, since then web links would be embedding the protocol version number. As a result, we&#x27;d need to keep old versions of TLS around indefinitely to make sure old URLs still work. I wish we could go the other way - and make http:&#x2F;&#x2F; implicitly use TLS when TLS is available. Having http:&#x2F;&#x2F;...&#x2F;x and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;...&#x2F;x be able to resolve to different resources was a huge mistake. reply cpach 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Regarding your last paragraph: Isn’t that pretty much solved thanks to HSTS preload? A non-technical author of a small recipe blog might not know how to set it up, but a bank ought to have staff (and auditors) who takes care of stuff like that. reply account42 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of a client having to treat https:&#x2F;&#x2F; and http:&#x2F;&#x2F; URLs with the same string after the :&#x2F;&#x2F; as distinct resources. reply dotancohen 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Are there any real world online resources where, modulo redirect, a different resource is presented on the HTTP and the HTTPS protocols? Or alternatively, on ports 80 and 443? reply ekr____ 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There used to be, though it&#x27;s less true now. However, the reason to treat them distinctly (as different origins, technically) is that HTTPS provides integrity whereas HTTP does not. So, consider the case where the client enters an HTTP URL and is redirected, just as you say above. If the attacker injects their own JS and it is cached in an origin that is just `example.com`, then they control the user&#x27;s experience of the site, even if later the user securely goes to the site with HTTPS. reply dotancohen 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Thank you. That really is a novel attack that I didn&#x27;t think of. reply pcthrowaway 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; As a result, we&#x27;d need to keep old versions of TLS around indefinitely to make sure old URLs still work Wouldn&#x27;t we be able to just redirect https-&gt;httpt like http requests do right now? Sure it&#x27;d be a tiny bit more overhead for servers, but no different than what we already experienced moving away from unencrypted http reply ekr____ 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This has a number of negative downstream effects. First, recall that links are very often inter-site, so the consequence would be that even when a server upgraded to TLS 1.2, clients would still try to connect with TLS 1.1 because they were using the wrong kind of link. This would relay delay deployment. By contrast, today when the server upgrades then new clients upgrade as well. Second, in the Web security model, the Origin of a resource (e.g., the context in which the JS runs) is based on scheme&#x2F;host&#x2F;port. So httpt would be a different origin from HTTPS. Consider what happens if the incoming link is https and internal links are httpt now different pages are different origins for the same site. These considerations are so important that when QUIC was developed, the IETF decided that QUIC would also be an https URL (it helps that IETF QUIC&#x27;s cryptographic handshake is TLS 1.3). reply tgma 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] TLS is one of the best success stories of widely applied security with great UX. It would be nowhere as successful with that attitude. reply account42 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yes it would absolutely have been insane. reply immibis 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You mean like the way we use h2:&#x2F;&#x2F; everywhere now? Oh wait, we don&#x27;t. reply Dylan16807 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Depends on what you mean by &quot;this kind&quot; because you want a way to detect attacker-forced downgrades and that used to be missing. reply frollogaston 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If a protocol is widely used wrongly, I consider it a flaw in the protocol. But overall, SSL standardization has gone decently well. I always bring it up as a good example to contrast with XMPP as a bad example. reply mcpherrinm 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Well, my only real point is that it’s not the version negotiation in TLS that’s broken. It’s the workaround for intolerance of newer versions that had downgrade attacks. Fortunately that’s all behind us now, and transitioning from 1.2 to 1.3 is going much smoother than 1.0 to 1.2 went. reply tialaramex 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] One of the big differences was in attitude. The TLS 1.3 anti-downgrade feature was not compatible with some popular middlebox products. Google told people too bad, either your vendor fixes it (most shipped free bug fixes for this issue, presumably &quot;encouraged&quot; by the resulting customer anger) or you can&#x27;t run Chrome once this temporary fudge goes away in a year&#x27;s time. Previously (in earlier protocol versions) nobody stood up to the crap middleboxes even though it&#x27;s bad for all normal users. reply drob518 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The service providers were the worst offenders here because they wanted to be the MIM to be able to look at the data and “add value” to their networks some how. Moving to TLS 1.3 took a lot of that away from them and it was only Google’s market power that could break them. reply frollogaston 9 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Similar thing has been happening with email sender auth, with Gmail and other big providers enforcing things adgjlsfhk1 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Any chance that can be used to undo lots of the ossification that made QUIC a UDP based hack rather than it&#x27;s own level 4 protocol? reply frollogaston 38 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] It&#x27;s probably too hard to get NATs to agree on a new L4 protocol. reply meepmorp 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; I always bring it up as a good example to contrast with XMPP as a bad example. Could you expand a bit here? Do you just mean how extensions to the protocol are handled, etc., or the overall process and involved parties? reply frollogaston 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] XMPP is too loose. Easiest comparison is security alone. XMPP auth and encryption are complicated, and they&#x27;re optional for each of c2s, s2c, s2s (setting aside e2e). Clients and servers will quietly do the wrong thing if not configured exactly right. Email has similar problems, so bad that entire companies exist just to help set up stuff like DMARC, but that&#x27;s a simpler app than instant messaging. The rest of the XMPP feature set is also super loose. Clients and servers never agree on what extensions to implement, even for very basic things like chat rooms. I really tried to like it before giving up. Edit: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.xmpp.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;Securing_XMPP SSL is appropriately strict. Auth and encryption, both c2s and s2c, go together. They were a bit lax on upgrades in the past, but as another comment said, Google just said you fix your stuff or else Chrome will show a very scary banner on your website. Yes you can skip it or force special things like auth without encryption, but it&#x27;s impossible to do by accident. reply meepmorp 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] thanks for taking the time to respond! reply sjducb 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Man in the middle interfering with TLS handshakes? The handshake is unencrypted so you can modify the messages to make it look like the server only supports broken ciphers. Then the man in the middle can read all of the encrypted data because it was badly encrypted. A surprising number of servers still support broken ciphers due to legacy uses or incompetence. reply ekr____ 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, this is a seriously difficult problem with only partial solutions. The basic math of any kind of negotiation is that you need the minimum set of cryptographic parameters supported by both sides to be secure enough to resist downgrade. This is too small a space to support a complete accounting of the situation, but roughly: - In pre-TLS 1.3 versions of TLS, the Finished message was intended to provide secure negotiation as long as the weakest joint key exchange was secure, even if the weakest joint record protection algorithm was insecure, because the Finished provides integrity for the handshake outside of the record layer. - In TLS 1.3, the negotiation messages are also signed by the server, which is intended to protect negotiation as long as the weakest joint signature algorithm is secure. This is (I believe) the best you can do with a client and server which have never talked to each other, because if the signature algorithm is insecure, the attacker can just impersonate the server directly. - TLS 1.3 also includes a mechanism intended to prevent against TLS 1.3 -&gt; TLS 1.2 downgrade as long as the TLS 1.2 cipher suite involves server signing (as a practical matter, this means ECDHE). Briefly, the idea is to use a sentinel value in the random nonces, which are signed even in TLS 1.2 ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc8446#section-4.1.3 ). reply mcpherrinm 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] No: while the handshake is unencrypted, it is authenticated. An attacker can’t modify it. What an attacker can do is block handshakes with parameters they don’t like. Some clients would retry a new handshake with an older TLS version, because they’d take the silence to mean that the server has broken negotiation. reply mcpherrinm 52 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] well, unless both client and server have sufficiently weak crypto enabled that an attacker can break it during the handshake. Then you can MITM, force both sides to use the weak crypto, which can be broken, and you&#x27;re in the middle. Also not really so relevant today. reply kevincox 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You could encrypt the handshake that you recieved with the server&#x27;s certificate and send it back. Then if it doesn&#x27;t match what the server thought it sent it aborts the handshake. As long as the server&#x27;s cert isn&#x27;t broken this would detect a munged handshake, and if the server&#x27;s cert is broken you have no root of trust to start the connection in the first place. reply sjducb 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] How do you agree a protocol to encrypt the message to agree the protocol? This is the message that returns a list of supported ciphers and key exchange protocols. There’s no data in this first packet. Alice: I’d like to connect Bob: Sure here is a list of protocols we could use: You modify bob’s message so that bob only suggests insecure protocols. You might be proposing that Alice asks Trent for Bob’s public key … But that’s not how TLS works. reply lxgr 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Bob&#x27;s list of supported protocols is an input into the (authenticated) final handshake message, and that authentication failing will prevent the connection from being considered successfully established. If the &quot;negotiated&quot; cipher suite is weak enough to allow real-time impersonation of Bob, though, pre-1.3 versions are still vulnerable; that&#x27;s another reason not to keep insecure cipher suites around in a TLS config. reply dotancohen 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The fine man in the middle could still intercept that. reply jackgavigan 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It also enabled cipher strength &quot;step up&quot;. Back during the &#x27;90s and early 2000s (I&#x27;m not sure when it stopped, tbh), the US government restricted the export of strong cryptography, with certain exceptions (e.g. for financial services). If you fell under one of those exceptions, you could get a special certificate for your website (from, e.g. Verisign) that allowed the webserver to &quot;step up&quot; the encryption negotiation with the browser to stronger algorithms and&#x2F;or key lengths. reply da_chicken 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] They still should have just called it TLS v4.0 instead of v1.0.

I mean, for one thing, they always worked in IE, which was really the only avenue through which MS could have affected them. No, Java applets failed because they became the poster child for &quot;Java is slow&quot; take. Even though it wasn&#x27;t exactly true in general, it was certainly true of applets, what with waiting for them to download and then waiting for the JVM to spin up. What killed them was 1) HTML&#x2F;JS itself getting better at dynamic stuff that previously required something like applets, and 2) Flash taking over the remaining niche for which HTML wasn&#x27;t good enough. reply cap11235 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Even prior to HTML5 stuff, Flash was just a better UX than applets, which always felt like your browser was loading an application, vs being an element in a page. reply immibis 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Another reason Java applets ultimately failed was the never-ending stream of sandbox escapes, which is inherent to their design of running trusted and untrusted code in the same VM and trying to keep track of which is which. It turns out it&#x27;s much more straightforward to sandbox the whole VM. A representative vulnerability is &quot;trusted method chaining&quot;. You (the attacker) construct a chain of standard library objects that call each other in unexpected ways. You can make use of the fact that you can subclass a standard library class and implement a standard library interface, in order to implement the interface methods with the base class&#x27;s implementations, to construct more unusual pathways. Then you get some standard library entry point to call the first method in the chain. Since your code doesn&#x27;t appear on the call stack at any point (it&#x27;s just the standard library calling the standard library) whatever is at the bottom of the call stack, at the end of the chain, infers a trusted context and can access files or whatever. Of course, finding a method chain that&#x27;s possible to construct and does something malicious is non-trivial. reply cubefox 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Java Applets also froze the entire browser when loading.

As the headlined article says, that contrived distinction seems silly with the hindsight of decades. The nomenclature was complicated in people&#x27;s minds by SMTP. Because there was SMTP over a largely transparent encrypted connection, and SMTP where it started unencrypted and negotiated a switch, as well as plain old cleartext. It didn&#x27;t help that RFC 2487 explained that STARTTLS negotiated &quot;TLS more commonly known as SSL&quot;. RFC 8314 explains some of the historical mess that SMTP got into with two types of SMTP (relay and submission) and three types of transport. And the &quot;S&quot; for &quot;submission&quot; could be confused with the &quot;S&quot;s in both &quot;SSL&quot; and &quot;TLS&quot;. It&#x27;s not just TLAs that are ambiguous, indeed.

They&#x27;re names of specific protocols with specific capabilities and versions. &quot;SSL 1.0&quot; and &quot;TLS 1.0&quot; are very different. (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;compare&#x2F;the-difference-between-ssl-an... ) The important bits: - &quot;SSL&quot; is a set of protocols so ridiculously old, busted and insecure that nobody should ever use them. It&#x27;s like talking about Sanskrit; ancient and dead. - &quot;TLS&quot; is way better than &quot;SSL&quot;, but still there are insecure versions. Any version before 1.2 is no longer supported due to security holes. - Technically an &quot;ssl certificate&quot; is neither &quot;SSL&quot; nor &quot;TLS&quot;, it&#x27;s really an &quot;X.509 Certificate with Extended Key Usage: Server Authentication&quot;. But that doesn&#x27;t roll off the tongue. You could use a cert from 1996 in a modern TLS server; the problem would be its expiration date, and the hash&#x2F;signature functions used back then are deprecated. (some servers still support insecure methods to support older clients, which is bad) reply creatonez 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The point is more that SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 were nearly identical.

Transport Layer Security is widely documented as beginning in 1999. I can find references to &quot;Thread Local Storage&quot; going back to at least 1996. That particular term seems more common in the Microsoft (and maybe IBM, does anyone have an OS&#x2F;2 programming manual?) world at the time; Pthreads (1995) and Unix in general tended to call it &quot;thread-specific data&quot;. It&#x27;s possible that the highly influential 2001 Itanium ABI document (which directly led to Drepper&#x27;s TLS paper) brought the term to (widespread) use in the broader Unix world, though Sun (for both Solaris and Java?) was using the term previously.

In theory TLS could be a transport-layer security mechanism that would let arbitrary protocols run on top of it (like IPSec does), but in practice it&#x27;s pretty much tied up to TCP sockets. The UDP variant (DTLS, and I suppose QUIC) isn&#x27;t part of the TLS spec for instance. Of course we have kernel TLS on Linux now, and Windows also has infrastructure like that, but it isn&#x27;t as easy as setting a flag on a socket to turn TLS on.

Snakes are badass. reply somat 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Speaking of ipsec, ipsec was supposed to be &quot;the&quot; encrypted interchange on the internet, basically used for random secure connections like we use tls today. I like to imagine an alternate past where ipsec &quot;won&quot; and how that would affect our expectations of secure connections. One thing different is that the security would handled at the os level instead of the application level, on the one hand this is nice all application get a secure connection whether they want one or not, on the other hand the application has no idea it is using a secure transport and has no way of indicating this to the user. Anyhow the opportunistic connection employment of ipsec never really got implemented and all we use it for anymore is as a dedicated tunnel. one that is fiendishly difficult to employ. I think the primary problem with ipsec is that it tried to be too flexible. this made setting up a ipsec link a non-trivial exercise in communication, and the process never got streamlined enough to just be invisible and work. reply LukeShu 22 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] No?

You don&#x27;t do this in TLS (as opposed to DTLS) because it runs over TCP and therefore you are guaranteed in-order delivery.

The code above is part of a system I wrote that extracts detailed certificate information from HTTPS connections, and man was it ever a hassle to wrestle all the information I was interested in out of the java standard library. Sure on the one hand it&#x27;s easier to not mess up if it&#x27;s all automatic and out of sight, but at the same time, it&#x27;s not exactly beneficial to the spread of deeper awareness of how TLS actually works when it&#x27;s always such a black box. reply israrkhan 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I think most people call it SSL because they use OpenSSL library to deal with secure communication have SSL in their names.

I remember this moment and this is where I realized that Microsoft wasn&#x27;t always the bad guy here. They had the better implementation and were willing to share it. But Netscape in this instance acted like kids and wouldn&#x27;t cooperate at all. Which is why this meeting had to occur and by that point it was clear Netscape had lost the browser and it wasn&#x27;t going to be close. Hence the quick about face by Netscape to accept what was pretty much Microsoft&#x27;s proposed solution. I can&#x27;t speak to the rest of Microsoft&#x27;s browser decisions and given the court ruling it&#x27;s clear they weren&#x27;t the good guys either but this opened my eyes to the fact that all companies are the bad guys some time:) reply thayne 23 hours ago | parent | next [–] Forcing the name to be chnaged from SSL to TLS seems pretty petty to me.

It’s easy to retroactively view Netscape’s resistance as petty, but the power imbalance was real, and the fear of Microsoft co-opting the standard wasn’t paranoia. Some companies make abuse a business model. I don&#x27;t see how anyone can defend a position where they only look at isolated actions of a company and not their overall strategic positioning. There are boundaries. Ethical boundaries. If you never experience the consequences of your actions, if nobody ever objects to your behavior, you will not stop. Especially not a distributed organism of a company, which has no inherent ethical boundaries; its boundaries are those that affect business, so you need to teach them in business. If your business model is based on treating your own employees like slaves, it is you who is cancer, not the other. Calling that “kid-like behavior” is misguided on two levels. First, as noted, Netscape’s actions were arguably rational in context - pushing back against a powerful incumbent trying to steer an open standard toward a proprietary implementation. Second, the phrase itself leans on a dismissive and inaccurate stereotype. Kids aren’t inherently irrational or overly emotional; in fact, there’s substantial research showing that young people behave quite logically given their environment. Framing behavior this way isn’t just lazy; it reinforces the kind of condescension that later gets labeled as “adverse childhood experiences” in therapy, assuming someone even gets the chance to unpack and not replicate it. On both levels, it is DARVO. reply Consider applying for YC's Fall 2025 batch!

Etc. reply noduerme 25 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Those things do show an intergenerational evolution of complex techniques, though, if only by trial and error. Certainly at some level they must have understood the tumor to be the cause of a malady, for instance. Even now we know of drugs whose biological pathways are poorly understood. Scientific understanding often follows rather than precedes the discovery of a technique. Which is fine! Someone, somewhere, makes a discovery or an incremental improvement to a technique that works in practice. Eventually someone else comes along and tries to reason about how that works.

I might swear in a 1-on-1 conversation at work, but I definitely don&#x27;t drop swear words into documents that unknown people might see.

But I find interesting about corporations forbidding swearwords in code. I mean, the people responsible for forbidding swearwords rarely read code. And if they read code with any frequency and are somewhat proficient at it, most likely they have their own list of swearwords. Also we should look to add more keywords to programming languages that trigger naïve filters.

Reputational harm in the event that code needs to be shared. Say, the code gets read in court, or an outside consultant is brought in who is given access to the code. The company likely wants to maintain the same standard of professionalism that they expect when their employees write or utter spoken language in the workplace for the same reasons. 2. Similar to #1 but nuanced enough to deserve its own mention: code is a business asset. It can be sold or licensed out. The company may fear that language that it deems unprofessional could depreciate the value of that code in the context of selling or licensing it to 3rd parties. Personally I think that the fuss over &quot;bad words&quot; is deeply irrational to a religious degree.

You are making the assumption that laughing is always voluntary, and only to communicate that you find something amusing. Both parts of that are false - for example many people will laugh instinctively as part of a fight flight response when the perceive danger from others to communicate &quot;hey im with you and not scared, don&#x27;t hurt me more&quot;.

I completely disagree. It is a lot more absurd. Language is not a priori. It must be learned. It requires both a speaker and a listener. Both must understand the meaning of the spoken word as well as other factors of communication, including tone and body language, in order to interpret and understand the communicated meaning. The idea behind a &quot;bad word&quot; is that the word is offensive no matter what. It doesn&#x27;t matter what the dictionary definition of the word is, or the intended meaning of the word or the subject of the sentence that employed the word. The word is intrinsically &quot;just bad&quot; according to this religious belief. Objectively, sometimes there are polite ways to use a &quot;four letter&quot; word such as &quot;fuck.&quot; The preceding sentence is one such example. But ... if you hold the irrational view that I am describing, there is no such thing. It is ALWAYS &quot;bad.&quot; This is a faith based belief system. There is no grounding for such a position. Under such a position, even an academic discussion of the word would require it be censored for fear of offending someone. reply thfuran 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You describe it as a religious belief.

Yes. What&#x27;s your point? It doesn&#x27;t make those beliefs rational. Faith is belief in something despite the absence of evidence. I am using the term &quot;religious belief&quot; interchangeably with &quot;faith based belief system.&quot; &gt; belief that there are people with religious beliefs is anything but irrational. I have no idea what you are trying to say in this sentence. - I don&#x27;t &quot;believe&quot; that there are people with religious beliefs. I observe that to be the case. - I never described &quot;belief that there are people with religious beliefs&quot; as irrational. I think your point might be that, because there are people with irrational beliefs out there we must appease them? Or something? I really don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re trying to say here. There are people out there who believe in crazy things. We agree on that. How we should treat those people, or react to their existence, is entirely outside of the scope of conversation. It is perfectly acceptable to call an irrational belief irrational. We were talking about language and communication and the absurdity that there is a such thing as an arbitrary sequence of phones or characters that would cause anyone exposed to that to be offended.

Now I understand why we are talking passed each other. Thank you for the clarification. You are reframing my premise and, in doing so, changing it to something I never said. Although before I explain the source of our misunderstanding, I want to point out the irony that you are coming from a philosophically &quot;subjectivist&quot; position and are defending a philosophical &quot;intrinsicist&quot; position. Usually they are two opposite extremes and tend to be at odds with each other. Subjectivism is the idea that perception creates reality. We often will hear people use language like &quot;my truth&quot; vs &quot;your truth.&quot; Your position is subjectivist in the sense that you are clinging to a premise (that I never refuted or discussed) which states that &quot;SOME people are offended by certain words, therefore &#x27;bad words&#x27; exist.&quot; Again, that&#x27;s not the premise I stated or was discussing. But after your clarification, this is the premise that you thought we were discussing. The intrinscist position states: &quot;Certain words are bad by their nature. They will automatically cause ANYONE who hears them to be offended.&quot; it is the &quot;intrinsicist&quot; position that I was calling absurd. I never said that there aren&#x27;t people who hold this belief. And I never said that there was no such thing as PEOPLE who get offended by words. I was saying that the idea that a word unto itself can be &quot;bad by nature&quot; is absurd. And I stand by that. reply thfuran 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I have made no claim of any kind about the inherent badness of words. I&#x27;m just saying that your claim that &gt;The idea that arbitrary sequences of phones or characters will cause anyone within ear or eye-shot to become offended is rather absurd is completely ridiculous. There plainly do exist words that offend people. Maybe you meant &#x27;everyone&#x27; rather than &#x27;anyone&#x27;? But that&#x27;s pretty much a straw man anyways. reply gspencley 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Maybe you meant &#x27;everyone&#x27; rather than &#x27;anyone&#x27;? Maybe. IMO the sentence works to convey the meaning I had intended either way. It is not a strawman to suggest that there are people, a lot of them, who believe that certain words are bad by nature. That any given person (the fully qualified way of expressing &quot;that anyone&quot;) who hears them will be offended, or have their soul diminished, or other bad things will happen as a result of hearing them. It&#x27;s not a strawman, because I grew up around such people. They exist. And that&#x27;s what I was talking about. And while I was not talking prescription - what we should do as a result of such people existing - I would ask a rhetorical question. WHY do people get offended by certain words? Is their offence rational?

People say &quot;shitty code&quot; all the time. I don&#x27;t see that as unprofessional. But &quot;dicks01&quot; I would probably change if I came across it in code. Not because I would find it offensive, but because it serves no purpose other than to be juvenile... and that can easily be counter-productive if the goal is easy to read and maintain code. With respects to &quot;shitty code&quot;, I&#x27;m not even sure that I would personally even consider the word &quot;shit&quot; to be a swear word in 2025. I&#x27;m reminded of the TV show on Showtime called Bullshit (by Penn &amp; Teller). They wanted to name the show &quot;Humbug&quot;, which was considered profane in the early 20th century when Houdini was alive and famous. But Showtime didn&#x27;t like it because they figured it wouldn&#x27;t land with a modern audience. &quot;Bullshit&quot; it was. That said, the article even includes the word &quot;crap&quot; (though perhaps they are making the point that it is replacing other, &quot;more profane&quot; words). That one strikes me as odd. If that is considered rude and offensive, then surely &quot;humbug&quot; ought to be as well. Probably very culture-specific. reply rybosome 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I have a very clear memory of offending someone with the use of the word “crap” years ago.

We were encouraged to offer customers who ordered a plain bowl of chili this noodle concoction instead. Late one night, I had a customer order a bowl of plain chili. I gave her the spiel I was supposed to, suggesting that she try the noodle dish. She said, “so you won’t sell me a bowl of chili?”. I replied, “sorry for the confusion ma’am, I am happy to sell you chili. We are asked to say this crap because management is worried customers don’t know what they want”. She replied, “I don’t think it’s appropriate for you to use the word ‘crap’ with me”. I apologized again, gave her her order, then was removed from my position 3 days later when she emailed management to complain. I had “refused to sell her chili”, and “used vulgar language”. reply fuzzy_biscuit 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I try to be silly rather than explicitly vulgar for my own sanity.

If we have to boil it down to two types, however, I&#x27;d split it as &quot;people who think they can do everything themselves and only the code matters&quot; and &quot;people who build effective teams capable of far more than themselves solo&quot;, and it&#x27;s the second group that does the most impressive things.

Linus made an enormous impact, certainly. He&#x27;d have had an even bigger impact if he was less of a caustic dick.

And one thing people seem to miss in this argument is that people can change, and generally will if they&#x27;re in an environment that facilitates it. If a skilled programmer gets constant pushback because they act like a jerk, they&#x27;ll probably figure out how to behave. reply mrguyorama 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Linus is a great example actually, because people pointed out he was being too much of an asshole, and he eventually agreed, and he reduced the toxicity of his rhetoric, but you can bet if the situation called for it, he would still use vulgarity to get his point across. If you totally ban profanity or vulgarity, all you do is force other words to take up the slack of what people use those words for, and therefore increase ambiguity. Don&#x27;t lazily add profanity to the code base because you are a child (ie no, don&#x27;t use &quot;fuck1&quot; as a variable name FFS) but if there is something truly insane going on, I&#x27;m going to write &quot;This is fucking magic&quot; in the code, and my coworkers will know to give that code the respect it deserves. Consider the fast inverse square root code. Most people only know it because &quot;what the fuck&quot; in a comment. Intensifiers are useful in communication. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tvtropes.org&#x2F;pmwiki&#x2F;pmwiki.php&#x2F;Main&#x2F;PrecisionFStrike Your code SHOULD have few swears because few situations deserve an intensifier like that, but some situations absolutely call for it. reply alistairSH 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] I&#x27;m going to write &quot;This is fucking magic&quot; in the code, and my coworkers will know to give that code the respect it deserves.

Sure, that&#x27;s the correct place to put that message. reply wat10000 15 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Funny, I think Linus is a great example for the opposite reason. He shows that if you stop tolerating bad behavior, people will often change how they behave. The idea that removing vulgarity will increase ambiguity in this context is very strange. In terms of communication, the only use for vulgarity is to convey emotion. That&#x27;s not relevant here. If we ban it, maybe people will explain why something is shit, instead of just saying it&#x27;s shit. Forcing other words to take up the slack is a feature, not a bug. I know about the fast inverse square root code. I could probably give a decent if somewhat vague overview of how it works from memory. I don&#x27;t recall the WTF comment, and that certainly isn&#x27;t why I heard about it. This is a great example of what I&#x27;m saying. Commenting 0x5f3759df &quot;what the fuck?&quot; isn&#x27;t useful. It tells me the author was confused or amazed or something. Imagine if instead they had commented, &quot;Compute an initial guess by negating and halving the exponent. 0x5f3759df was found by experimenting and seems to give a good guess in the mantissa bits.&quot; reply holowoodman 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I would say that a swearword where a swearword is due is actually effective and professional.

So just a mac address change gives extra internet. New Android versions make it especially convenient, with a &quot;Wi-Fi non-persistent MAC randomization&quot; option in the developer options, meaning you can just &quot;forget&quot; the wifi network and connect again with a fresh mac address. In some cases I&#x27;ve seen networks that allow any traffic on port 53 - it doesn&#x27;t have to be DNS traffic. The most surprising one was a mobile network with a pay as you go payment model: load money first, buy a data package, when the data package runs out, you get a captive portal that says &quot;you&#x27;ve run out of data&quot; - but port 53 wasn&#x27;t blocked, so a commercial VPN resulted in unlimited internet at unlimited speed, with roaming anywhere in the world (and that was back in the day before SIM card registration was required too, so anonymous, too). reply seszett 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] &gt; port 53 I haven&#x27;t needed it for... probably 15 years, but in the past (before 3G was common, and all you could rely on was WiFi hotspots) I have used iodine[0] as an IP over DNS tunnel. My uni friends were always impressed, and it really helped me a few times. The throughput was never great though, but enough for some basic browsing. Edit you have to be prepared ahead of time though, and it&#x27;s the main reason I bought my three-letter domain back then (shorter domain means higher throughput as payload is a higher percent of the query response).

I think in one of those two (forget which), they just had udp&#x2F;53 wide open (which works just like any VPN), but in the other, it had to do proper DNS tunneling.

Trapped on a cruise for a week, you are much more desperate for Internet. Plus you&#x27;ve paid a lot more for the trip and the fee doesn&#x27;t feel so large compared to all the other upsells. The cruise often is the vacation, whereas air travel is just the means to an end. reply baq 12 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] A cruise ship shouldn’t have any issues with having 10 or 20 terminals installed and the clear skies in all directions could mean each has its own bird. reply ceejayoz 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; The extra number of people on a cruise ship just means service degradation, not excess bandwidth consumption.

At 10k users and assuming a single terminal, and a single price, you are going to not going to be able to price it so as to optimize price vs performance. Personally I would have at least 2 terminals, a low tier and high tier. I would sell only a limited number of high tier connections, good for the entire trip. Probably included as a perk with first-class cabins. The low tier would be a daily purchase. I mean hotels have done this for ages. Maybe a dedicated business center with wired (dongle) connection and kiosk PCs, that gets the best bandwidth of all, but you&#x27;re away from ship activities. reply ajmurmann 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Cruises make most of their money now by upselling you on board.

So just a mac address change gives extra internet. New Android versions make it especially convenient, with a &quot;Wi-Fi non-persistent MAC randomization&quot; option in the developer options, meaning you can just &quot;forget&quot; the wifi network and connect again with a fresh mac address. In some cases I&#x27;ve seen networks that allow any traffic on port 53 - it doesn&#x27;t have to be DNS traffic. The most surprising one was a mobile network with a pay as you go payment model: load money first, buy a data package, when the data package runs out, you get a captive portal that says &quot;you&#x27;ve run out of data&quot; - but port 53 wasn&#x27;t blocked, so a commercial VPN resulted in unlimited internet at unlimited speed, with roaming anywhere in the world (and that was back in the day before SIM card registration was required too, so anonymous, too). reply seszett 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] &gt; port 53 I haven&#x27;t needed it for... probably 15 years, but in the past (before 3G was common, and all you could rely on was WiFi hotspots) I have used iodine[0] as an IP over DNS tunnel.

Probably included as a perk with first-class cabins. The low tier would be a daily purchase. I mean hotels have done this for ages.

My experience is not so much the attribution of human characteristics to non-human objects, but I understand why this might be the only accessible language of expression. For me, if a useful object is damaged or otherwise loses its usefulness through neglect or malice, I experience something like an emotional response. A good example would be a dull knife. There&#x27;s something &quot;sad&quot; about an object whose nature or purpose it is to be sharp to lose or lack that sharpness. Or perhaps a more subtle example would be a room whose contents are haphazard or in disarray. In that situation I would sense a lack of care or attention and there might be an emotional feeling that these objects had not been respected or appreciated. It&#x27;s (usually) easy for most people to care about other people. It&#x27;s a little less easy, though still pretty common, for people to care about animals. The further away from recognizably human you get, the less people seem to care: e.g. insects, plants, bacteria, viruses, etc. For me there is something that &quot;scales&quot; down all the way to inanimate objects. reply soulofmischief 4 hours ago | parent | next [–] I like the Japanese concept of Tsukumogami[0], where certain objects that live to be 100 years old become imbued with a soul. It&#x27;s easy to get sentimental over neglected things because I seem to have an innate appreciation and sense of duty toward objects that are designed to help people. It only seems fair that the contract includes care and maintenance from the user. I live in an aging neighborhood and weep for some of these homes. I visited an abandoned unit just this weekend and went through the spectrum of sadness and anger that such a beautiful building had been allowed to fall into such disrepair. The unit was unsafe to live in, the foundation is cracking in two, one wall has a crack so large that you can see the outside and in several places, the floor is close to caving in. But the outside of the building is so nice. :( We just bought a house in the neighborhood that is in mostly good shape considering its owners were older and lived there for over 20 years. I look forward to shaping her up, replacing the roof, refinishing the floors, repairing the foundation, fixing some water damage, etc. She&#x27;s a great little home and it pains me to see her not at her best.

AFAIK I am not affected by autism, but I distinctly remember when as a child I refused to eat something because that thing didn&#x27;t &quot;want&quot; to be eaten. I guess that from my parent&#x27;s perspective, it was just their child&#x27;s whim-of-the-day. But that memory makes me think that animism is something natural - perhaps some sort &quot;bug&quot; in the system that make us attribute intentions [2] to others.

The &quot;personality&quot; doesn&#x27;t have to match mine, or have any desirable traits, but it is there, it is because I am, and I&#x27;m shaping the thing by my own usage patterns. reply QuantumGood 21 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] I remember in the 1990&#x27;s when I felt very strongly that in chess, rook pawns could be advanced far more often than they were in Grandmaster games. And in recent years modern computers confirm that (it has been called &quot;the rook pawn revolution&quot;). Looking back on it a bit later, I realized I had no logical, left-brain systems support for it, only one of the strongest &quot;systems&quot; feelings I can remember ever having. I also grew up on the spectrum, with a side of moderately severe anxiety disorder, and extreme difficulty sleeping. reply tetromino_ 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; A good example would be a dull knife.

It&#x27;s a little less easy, though still pretty common, for people to care about animals. The further away from recognizably human you get, the less people seem to care I think this also explains a lot about how normal people behave. They not only care mostly about humans but mostly about their tribe . The operation of some system which is designed to protect everyone is only important when it&#x27;s protecting their own people and can be disregarded when that isn&#x27;t the case. Whereas people whose empathy extends past their own walls can feel a harm to the whole society when that happens. Even now I&#x27;m sure there are people reading this and thinking &quot;yes, the other tribe does that all the time! They&#x27;re such hypocrites!&quot; But that&#x27;s the easy one. The hard thing is to recognize it and stop it when you&#x27;re doing it. reply steve_adams_86 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I relate to this easily. My family finds it so strange that I can look at a flat tire and say something like &quot;aw, poor thing&quot;. And I&#x27;m half-joking, yet... Well, it gives me an emotional response. I think a lot of people can relate to that example in particular because there is a sort of &#x27;deflated&#x27; sense of self most people can experience, but not so much with the dull knife or a rock being split in half. Something I found which coincides somewhat well with what you&#x27;re saying: it seems like a disproportionate number of vegans are not neurotypical. I&#x27;m mostly plant-based because I can&#x27;t separate animals from humans enough. It feels wrong to eat them. Not that I lower humans to animal level, though. I raise animals, or the hierarchy is flatter. I also find insects so much more amazing—and neurologically salient I suppose—than virtually everyone I know. Yet in the isopod collecting hobby, you&#x27;ll find plenty of people who love insects and arachnids and so on, and they seem to lean towards neurodivergence as well. reply thayne 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] I relate to that. I wouldn&#x27;t say I attribute human characteristics to non-human objects, but I definitely feel emotional distress when I see objects destroyed harmed, throw away, etc. For me, I think a big part of it is a sense of waste or lost potential. If the object hadn&#x27;t been broken, it could have had longer useful life, and it upsets me that that was cut short. reply michaelg7x 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] I don&#x27;t find this surprising at all. Humans are tool-users, and valuing an object&#x27;s utility and experiencing a feeling of something like loss when it&#x27;s neglected or loses efficacy would seem to be an advantageous trait. reply thinkingemote 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] For me, even software running on devices can make the device &quot;content&quot; or &quot;unhappy&quot;. It&#x27;s like the software is in line with how the silicon wants to be. Its not design, it&#x27;s something deeper. Like a kind of flow state for bits. One large scale example could be linux vs windows on a server. Linux seems to be more attuned to how the system wants to run. With reflection this might be me combining anthropomorphising and my own prejudices and likes and biases with a projection of my personality onto the software. But I remember certain Windows applications felt they run better than others - even ones with worse design or that were proprietary. With more consideration this might be when computers had visual blinking LEDs and audible HD clicks and subliminal capacitor whine. If that&#x27;s the case then in my feeling, software that made conservative use of CPU and HD beyond looking nice might be &quot;happier&quot; than more popular applications. Writing the above I&#x27;m reminded of Terry Davis&#x27;s TempleOS but I&#x27;m not sure what to make of that feeling! reply tudorw 46 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] Are you familiar with Shinto, you might enjoy the perspective. reply cogman10 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Here&#x27;s where you can find the full paper. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;326979070_Object_pe...

For instance, I don&#x27;t perceive objects as human, honestly if I can help it I don&#x27;t even perceive humans as human. I have empathy for concepts that have nothing to do with humanity or with assigning things humanity or human characteristics. Nothing I do or feel is human-centric.

My own classification system: The more schizophrenic kind imparts a fantasy framing on everything which can give rise to a disorganised imparting of mental capacities that I think is fairly uniform across objects, including people. This appears as &quot;too few mental capacities&quot; on people, and too much to objects. This a &quot;living in their own world, dreaming&quot; type. Dreamer-type. At the other extreme, it&#x27;s a difficulty in establishing any kind of fantasy framing (without significant support, eg., in video games &#x2F; films). This is an officious, &quot;the rules really exist, and we must follow them&quot; type. Officious-type. Incidentally, imv, there&#x27;s a third sort you might call dissociative, where irony is the main mode of relation to the world and others. This is an unstable blending of the two perspectives: the ironic performative frame is at once a kind of fantasy, but a sort of fantasy which seeks to make the very adopting of fantasy impossible. Irony-type.

I know Dutch has fused masculine&#x2F;feminine nouns into a &quot;common&quot; gender, leaving the language with effectively only the common and neuter genders. If I remember correctly, a similar thing has happened in Swedish and Danish. Some languages have various concepts of animacy driving the system. Some languages have shitloads of noun classes. You can adjust your language depending on the biological gender of who you&#x27;re addressing in English, but English doesn&#x27;t have grammatical gender in any meaningful way.

Not the best data out there, sure, but it’s a start that could incentivize further research with proper sample sizes and procedures. This is an issue I’m acutely familiar with. Everything of import is, to a degree, personified. Not everything gets a name , necessarily, but everything has an “identity” which helps me to process events and interactions with it. AVR crashes? “Oh, she’s being pissy today.” Car taking a little longer to start in the morning? “I know girl, I’m tired too.” This extends to treatment: the more personified the object, the better its treatment. Stuffed animals get names and apologies, as does Siri (though the voice assistants also get a tongue lashing when they’re non-performant). When I retire something, I try to find it a good home before trashing it (which is why an old Pioneer HDMI 2.0 AVR is still sitting in a box, alone and unloved by a new owner). I treat objects with the same reverence I treat people, which earns me the occasional eyeroll.

Namely that they have less of a subjective or interior view on people, how other people see them and maybe how they see themselves (there&#x27;s some comments to that effect in this thread) Again because I don&#x27;t have direct experience with it I don&#x27;t want to lean too much into stereotypes, but it seems possible to me that people with autism have a more monistic, or at least less dualistic view on these things because the kind of thing that makes other people distinguish between subjects and objects is less present in people with autism. reply zzzeek 4 hours ago | prev | next [–] I had this to a significant degree as a child, back in the world where &quot;autism&quot; only meant &quot;profoundly non verbal&quot; and such a diagnosis had nothing to do with me (and yes it could be distressing. Even to this day I sometimes feel sad about deleting text in documents and replacing it with similar text, experiencing the desperation of a perfectly fine word about to no longer exist. I told a therapist about this like ten years ago and she looked me blankly. I guess I still have this). I wrote a whole essay called &quot;The Floor&#x27;s Opinion&quot; in grade school and I was hailed as a creative genius. In that recent story in the NYT about dating agencies for people on the spectrum, so many of the comments (in the NYT, not here) were very angry at how the definition of autism has been so greatly expanded in recent decades to include people who are high functioning. The commenters felt it took away from their own children&#x27;s diagnoses, not just in name but also in terms of competition for resources, and didnt see what the point was for people who were low on the spectrum.

Child neurological development goes through a lot of mirroring the environments they observe in play, and mapping them onto stuffed animals, dolls, bugs, pets, toys, etc. There&#x27;s an age where kids are developing interiority (children do not have an &quot;inner voice&quot; and do not develop it until 5-7, typically) and during that time, a lot of their play is them learning the rules and developing empathy (children do not have a concept of being able to put themselves in others shoes until age 3-7, typically). Autistic children are often times very interested in learning rules and applying them in other settings. Autistic young women, especially, are navigating a complicated social environment that strongly encourages them to understand the rules of what it means to be a woman in society. Learning those rules and then saying, &quot;Ok little (bugs|stuffed animals|toys), here&#x27;s how things work&quot; is both a thing kids do and a thing autistic kids do. Couple that with special interests (dinosaurs, trains, bugs, bones, whatever), and you&#x27;ll often see autistic kids getting WAY into one particular thing and then mapping the world they experience onto that thing. reply squigz 4 hours ago | prev | next [–] Published in 2018 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.se&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;1362361318793408 reply echohack5 4 hours ago | prev | next [–] &lt;Date Everything! has entered the chat&gt; reply gryfft 3 hours ago | parent | next [–] Oh jeez, can&#x27;t Date Everything! at least buy the chat dinner first?! reply wcoenen 4 hours ago | prev [–] &gt; We carried out an online survey, administered via Survey Monkey This type of thing, where they do some statistics on survey data, seems to be fairly typical in psychology research.

My experience is not so much the attribution of human characteristics to non-human objects, but I understand why this might be the only accessible language of expression. For me, if a useful object is damaged or otherwise loses its usefulness through neglect or malice, I experience something like an emotional response. A good example would be a dull knife. There&#x27;s something &quot;sad&quot; about an object whose nature or purpose it is to be sharp to lose or lack that sharpness. Or perhaps a more subtle example would be a room whose contents are haphazard or in disarray. In that situation I would sense a lack of care or attention and there might be an emotional feeling that these objects had not been respected or appreciated. It&#x27;s (usually) easy for most people to care about other people. It&#x27;s a little less easy, though still pretty common, for people to care about animals. The further away from recognizably human you get, the less people seem to care: e.g. insects, plants, bacteria, viruses, etc. For me there is something that &quot;scales&quot; down all the way to inanimate objects. reply soulofmischief 4 hours ago | parent | next [–] I like the Japanese concept of Tsukumogami[0], where certain objects that live to be 100 years old become imbued with a soul.

But the outside of the building is so nice. :( We just bought a house in the neighborhood that is in mostly good shape considering its owners were older and lived there for over 20 years.

I think a lot of people can relate to that example in particular because there is a sort of &#x27;deflated&#x27; sense of self most people can experience, but not so much with the dull knife or a rock being split in half.

I&#x27;m mostly plant-based because I can&#x27;t separate animals from humans enough. It feels wrong to eat them. Not that I lower humans to animal level, though. I raise animals, or the hierarchy is flatter. I also find insects so much more amazing—and neurologically salient I suppose—than virtually everyone I know.

If the object hadn&#x27;t been broken, it could have had longer useful life, and it upsets me that that was cut short. reply michaelg7x 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] I don&#x27;t find this surprising at all. Humans are tool-users, and valuing an object&#x27;s utility and experiencing a feeling of something like loss when it&#x27;s neglected or loses efficacy would seem to be an advantageous trait. reply thinkingemote 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] For me, even software running on devices can make the device &quot;content&quot; or &quot;unhappy&quot;. It&#x27;s like the software is in line with how the silicon wants to be. Its not design, it&#x27;s something deeper. Like a kind of flow state for bits. One large scale example could be linux vs windows on a server. Linux seems to be more attuned to how the system wants to run. With reflection this might be me combining anthropomorphising and my own prejudices and likes and biases with a projection of my personality onto the software. But I remember certain Windows applications felt they run better than others - even ones with worse design or that were proprietary. With more consideration this might be when computers had visual blinking LEDs and audible HD clicks and subliminal capacitor whine. If that&#x27;s the case then in my feeling, software that made conservative use of CPU and HD beyond looking nice might be &quot;happier&quot; than more popular applications.

For instance, I don&#x27;t perceive objects as human, honestly if I can help it I don&#x27;t even perceive humans as human. I have empathy for concepts that have nothing to do with humanity or with assigning things humanity or human characteristics. Nothing I do or feel is human-centric.

My own classification system: The more schizophrenic kind imparts a fantasy framing on everything which can give rise to a disorganised imparting of mental capacities that I think is fairly uniform across objects, including people. This appears as &quot;too few mental capacities&quot; on people, and too much to objects. This a &quot;living in their own world, dreaming&quot; type. Dreamer-type. At the other extreme, it&#x27;s a difficulty in establishing any kind of fantasy framing (without significant support, eg., in video games &#x2F; films). This is an officious, &quot;the rules really exist, and we must follow them&quot; type. Officious-type. Incidentally, imv, there&#x27;s a third sort you might call dissociative, where irony is the main mode of relation to the world and others. This is an unstable blending of the two perspectives: the ironic performative frame is at once a kind of fantasy, but a sort of fantasy which seeks to make the very adopting of fantasy impossible. Irony-type. I think quite a lot of &quot;high-engagement culture&quot; (ie., the type which requires a lot of its audience) is really autistic culture of these varieties in interaction. reply _0ffh 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; I always had the impression it was the other way around, non autistic &#x27;normal&#x27; people personifies non human objects.

Sometimes this manifests as higher levels of empathy for objects and animals, or higher emotional empathy. I&#x27;m dx&#x27;d autistic, and I am someone who will weep openly or experience unbridled joy alongside, say, a movie about a bunch of animals surviving tough times. But if I see an adult human make a poor choice and suffer consequences I feel nothing. I have to teach myself that my values are that we should care for everyone -- even the people I feel no intrinsic empathy towards.

The modern meaning was introduced in the 1950s&#x2F;60s to differentiate social aspects (gender) from biological (sex). Of course people then started using it to just mean &quot;sex&quot;, but if you use social definition I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad name for the concept. reply energywut 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It&#x27;s not the worst name for the concept when you include &quot;a male&quot; and &quot;a female&quot; as prominent nouns in that noun class. If you adjust your language depending on whether you are addressing a man or a woman (or speaking about a man or woman), then it&#x27;s definitely also social gender (as well as grammatical gender), even if those two concepts are separate. reply seabird 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Except there&#x27;s no mandate that &quot;a male&quot; and &quot;a female&quot; are of different noun classes, nor are the nouns for man&#x2F;woman abnormally privileged in most cases. I know Dutch has fused masculine&#x2F;feminine nouns into a &quot;common&quot; gender, leaving the language with effectively only the common and neuter genders. If I remember correctly, a similar thing has happened in Swedish and Danish. Some languages have various concepts of animacy driving the system. Some languages have shitloads of noun classes. You can adjust your language depending on the biological gender of who you&#x27;re addressing in English, but English doesn&#x27;t have grammatical gender in any meaningful way. The concepts are largely orthogonal. Calling it gender really is just a bad, misleading name in the grand scheme of things. reply drewcoo 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Grammatical use came first by far. reply burnt-resistor 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] Reminds me of a theme in the cult classic Shooting Fish where the more technical-minded con artist was accused of repairing old household appliances out of pity. reply carterschonwald 4 hours ago | prev | next [–] I don’t experience that at all, but definitely do associatively recall all the nontrivial uses &#x2F; interactions I’ve had with items.

People do it all the time with ships, cars, guns, computers, or whatever other machines they work with, whatever is important to them and complex enough to have a personality of its own. reply mlinhares 4 hours ago | parent | next [–] Same here, feels like a pretty normal trait, both my kids have this with their favorite toys (I had the same as well) and nowadays I do have attachment to some of my stuff, specially my kitchen utensils&#x2F;devices, my kitchen aid mixer (10 years old now) even has a name.

Not the best data out there, sure, but it’s a start that could incentivize further research with proper sample sizes and procedures. This is an issue I’m acutely familiar with. Everything of import is, to a degree, personified. Not everything gets a name , necessarily, but everything has an “identity” which helps me to process events and interactions with it. AVR crashes? “Oh, she’s being pissy today.” Car taking a little longer to start in the morning? “I know girl, I’m tired too.” This extends to treatment: the more personified the object, the better its treatment. Stuffed animals get names and apologies, as does Siri (though the voice assistants also get a tongue lashing when they’re non-performant). When I retire something, I try to find it a good home before trashing it (which is why an old Pioneer HDMI 2.0 AVR is still sitting in a box, alone and unloved by a new owner). I treat objects with the same reverence I treat people, which earns me the occasional eyeroll. I’d love to know more about why this phenomena is so prevalent in autistic people, and what the benefits or harms of it are.

Namely that they have less of a subjective or interior view on people, how other people see them and maybe how they see themselves (there&#x27;s some comments to that effect in this thread) Again because I don&#x27;t have direct experience with it I don&#x27;t want to lean too much into stereotypes, but it seems possible to me that people with autism have a more monistic, or at least less dualistic view on these things because the kind of thing that makes other people distinguish between subjects and objects is less present in people with autism. reply zzzeek 4 hours ago | prev | next [–] I had this to a significant degree as a child, back in the world where &quot;autism&quot; only meant &quot;profoundly non verbal&quot; and such a diagnosis had nothing to do with me (and yes it could be distressing. Even to this day I sometimes feel sad about deleting text in documents and replacing it with similar text, experiencing the desperation of a perfectly fine word about to no longer exist. I told a therapist about this like ten years ago and she looked me blankly. I guess I still have this). I wrote a whole essay called &quot;The Floor&#x27;s Opinion&quot; in grade school and I was hailed as a creative genius. In that recent story in the NYT about dating agencies for people on the spectrum, so many of the comments (in the NYT, not here) were very angry at how the definition of autism has been so greatly expanded in recent decades to include people who are high functioning. The commenters felt it took away from their own children&#x27;s diagnoses, not just in name but also in terms of competition for resources, and didnt see what the point was for people who were low on the spectrum. But I will say when they identify specific traits that I&#x27;ve always wondered about and even told clueless therapists about, it feels way better to know a little bit of the reasoning for why you have some freakish habit. reply drivingmenuts 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] &quot;Normal people&quot; do it, too - ask a sailor about ship.

Child neurological development goes through a lot of mirroring the environments they observe in play, and mapping them onto stuffed animals, dolls, bugs, pets, toys, etc. There&#x27;s an age where kids are developing interiority (children do not have an &quot;inner voice&quot; and do not develop it until 5-7, typically) and during that time, a lot of their play is them learning the rules and developing empathy (children do not have a concept of being able to put themselves in others shoes until age 3-7, typically). Autistic children are often times very interested in learning rules and applying them in other settings. Autistic young women, especially, are navigating a complicated social environment that strongly encourages them to understand the rules of what it means to be a woman in society. Learning those rules and then saying, &quot;Ok little (bugs|stuffed animals|toys), here&#x27;s how things work&quot; is both a thing kids do and a thing autistic kids do. Couple that with special interests (dinosaurs, trains, bugs, bones, whatever), and you&#x27;ll often see autistic kids getting WAY into one particular thing and then mapping the world they experience onto that thing. reply squigz 4 hours ago | prev | next [–] Published in 2018 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.se&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;1362361318793408 reply echohack5 4 hours ago | prev | next [–] &lt;Date Everything! has entered the chat&gt; reply gryfft 3 hours ago | parent | next [–] Oh jeez, can&#x27;t Date Everything! at least buy the chat dinner first?! reply wcoenen 4 hours ago | prev [–] &gt; We carried out an online survey, administered via Survey Monkey This type of thing, where they do some statistics on survey data, seems to be fairly typical in psychology research.

In online forums, autistic individuals commonly report experiencing this phenomenon. Given that approximately half of all autistic individuals experience difficulties identifying their own emotions, the suggestion that object personification may be a feature of autism seems almost paradoxical. Why would a person experience sympathy for objects, when they struggle to understand and verbalise the emotions of other people as well as their own? An online survey was used to assess tendency for personification in 87 autistic and 263 non-autistic adults. Together, our results indicate that object personification occurs commonly among autistic individuals, and perhaps more often (and later in life) than in the general population. Given that in many cases, autistic people report their personification experiences as distressing, it is important to consider the reasons for the increased personification and identify structures for support.

https://voxelmanip.se/2025/06/14/jokes-and-humour-in-the-public-android-api/|Jokes and Humour in the public Android API - ROllerozxa|Jokes and Humour in the public Android API - ROllerozxa ROllerozxa Posts Projects Uses Files About Donate Jokes and Humour in the public Android API 14 June 2025 1599 words Android Humourous Previously I have covered a relatively obscure now-removed placeholder string in Android that doubles as an easter egg, the fictitious carrier by the name of El Telco Loco . But this time it is about methods and other parts of the publicly facing Android API that may generally be more humourous than they are useful. Easter eggs, jokes, whatever you want to call them, that are visible to Android app developers rather than regular users. ActivityManager.isUserAMonkey() (reference) While it may initially look like a joke when it’s described as returning true if the UI is “currently being messed with by a monkey” without any further elaboration in the documentation, this is probably the one in the list with the most usefulness attached to it. It is referring to the UI Exerciser Monkey , which is a developer tool for Android that simulates random sequences of user input in order to stress-test apps. So this method will return a boolean of whether the Monkey is currently running or not. The introduction of such a method to detect the usage of the Monkey appears to have an origin in something that happened during Android’s development, as per a quote from the book Androids: The Team that Built the Android Operating System : One day I walked into the monkey lab to hear a voice say, ‘911 -What’s your emergency?” That situation resulted in Dianne adding a new function to the API, isUserAMonkey() which is used to gate actions that monkeys shouldn’t take during tests (including dialing the phone and resetting the device). Indeed, when feeding random and inherently unpredictable input into an app, you would want to have some way of locking away portions of an app that may have unintended real-world consequences such as calling emergency services. As such, isUserAMonkey was implemented and later made its way into the public API in Android 2.2 Froyo (API 8). UserManager.isUserAGoat() (reference) This one is more of a joke. The developer documentation says it is “used to determine whether the user making this call is subject to teleportations”, which in itself is likely a reference to a hidden column in the Chrome task manager that shows how many goats a browser process has teleported. It was first introduced in Android 4.2 (API 17), and originally just returned false. However in Android 5.0 Lollipop (API 21) it was changed to “automatically identify goats using advanced goat recognition technology”. The game Goat Simulator had released earlier that year and was made available for Android in September during Lollipop’s development, so this method was changed to instead detect the presence of the Android version of Goat Simulator being installed on the device: public boolean isUserAGoat () { return mContext . getPackageManager () . isPackageAvailable ( "com.coffeestainstudios.goatsimulator" ); } Later in Android 11 (API 30), it was changed such that apps targetting API 30 and above will once again always return false when the method is called. According to the developer documentation this was made to “protect goat privacy”. if ( mContext . getApplicationInfo (). targetSdkVersion &gt;= Build . VERSION_CODES . R ) { return false ; } Android 11 is also the version where the QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission was introduced, meaning that apps targetting Android 11 would not be able to query for information of other apps through the PackageManager without this permission. So it makes sense to also wall off this method in order to not leak any information about other apps installed on an user’s device, even as a joke. UserManager.DISALLOW_FUN (reference) This constant refers to a device policy added in Android 6 Marshmallow (API 23) which restricts the user from having “fun”. The description given in the developer documentation is, ironically, amusing and reminds me of something GLaDOS would probably say: Specifies if the user is not allowed to have fun. In some cases, the device owner may wish to prevent the user from experiencing amusement or joy while using the device. This is in fact a real device policy that a device owner may change to restrict what users of the device is able to do with it. And third-parties can then hook into this to disable features of their app that are deemed “too fun”. I don’t know if any third-party apps actually make use of it, but in the Android system it is used to disable the Android version easter egg that shows up when pressing the version label in the settings. Considering that “fun” easter eggs like the Google Chrome “No internet” Dinosaur minigame end up being distractions that e.g. schools want to disable for enrolled devices ( see Chromium issue #41159706 ), maybe the Android version easter egg could very much be a distraction depending on the version. Chronometer.isTheFinalCountdown() (reference) The Chronometer class had a new method by the name of isTheFinalCountdown added to it in Android 8 Oreo (API 26). When called, it will send an Intent to open the YouTube video for The Final Countdown by Europe. No really. That’s what it does: try { getContext (). startActivity ( new Intent ( Intent . ACTION_VIEW , Uri . parse ( "https://youtu.be/9jK-NcRmVcw" )) . addCategory ( Intent . CATEGORY_BROWSABLE ) . addFlags ( Intent . FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT | Intent . FLAG_ACTIVITY_LAUNCH_ADJACENT )); return true ; } catch ( Exception e ) { return false ; } Marvelous. PackageManager.FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN_MULTITOUCH_JAZZHAND (reference) This constant was added in Android 2.3 Gingerbread (API 8) and is used to describe a device that supports tracking 5 simultaneous touch inputs, with the name being a reference to Jazz hands . Log.wtf() (reference) According to the developer documentation, WTF stands for “What a Terrible Failure” (sure…), and is intended to log things that should never happen. It logs the message at the assertion level. AdapterViewFlipper.fyiWillBeAdvancedByHostKThx() (reference) This is a method with an oddly humourous informal name, which was likely caused by some developer coming up blank on naming it and has now ended up in the public Android API, being added in Android 3.0 Honeycomb (API 11). It gets called by an AppWidgetHost when advancing the views inside of the AdapterViewFlipper object. Indeed, naming things is one of the two hard problems in computer science, the other being off-by-one errors and cache invalidation. IBinder.TWEET_TRANSACTION (reference) The Android Binder system is used for performing IPC and transactions are distinguished using different types, one of them being… TWEET_TRANSACTION . It was added in Android 3.2 Honeycomb (API 13) and claims to be used to send a tweet to a target object. It does not actually do anything, let alone send a tweet. The document mentions that messages have a limit of 130 characters, referencing Twitter’s old message character limit. IBinder.LIKE_TRANSACTION (reference) In a similar fashion, a new transaction type by the name of LIKE_TRANSACTION was added in Android 4.0.3 ICS (API 15). It’s used to tell an app that the caller likes it, there is no counter to keep track of the amount of likes but it is claimed that sending such transactions will improve the app’s self-esteem. SensorManager.SENSOR_TRICORDER (reference) I do have to admit I didn’t know what a Tricorder is, but it appears to be a fictional device from Star Trek and the constant was “added” in Android 1.0 (meaning it likely was present since before Android’s first official release). The SENSOR_* constants in SensorManager have since then been deprecated in API level 15 in favour of the Sensor class, which does not include any equivalent reference to the Tricorder. Unfortunate. SensorManager.GRAVITY_* (reference) The SensorManager class has a lot of constants which store the gravitational velocity of various bodies in our solar system ranging from GRAVITY_SUN to GRAVITY_PLUTO . While whether any of these outside of GRAVITY_EARTH is useful in any real-world scenarios is debatable, there are some that are actually just jokes. GRAVITY_DEATH_STAR_I stores the gravity of the first Death Star in SI units (referred to as Empire units). This appears to be a Star Wars reference. GRAVITY_THE_ISLAND stores the gravity of “the island”. Apparently this is a reference to The Island in the 2004 TV show Lost . &lt;blink&gt; Last one, and this one is particularly crazy. Did you know there is a hidden tag inside the Android view layout system by the name of &lt;blink&gt; ? Because that is a thing: // [TAG_1995 = "blink"] if ( name . equals ( TAG_1995 )) { // Let's party like it's 1995! return new BlinkLayout ( context , attrs ); } It makes any children that is wrapped inside of it blink, like the old &lt;blink&gt; HTML tag. This one appears to be completely undocumented in the Android Developer reference, but was added in a commit in 2011 with the title “Improve LayoutInflater’s compliance” (right…) and is still present in the AOSP master branch. Whether you should actually use it is debatable however. Donations Did you find the blog post to be informative, amusing or otherwise interesting?
