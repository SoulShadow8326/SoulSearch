Born in Kingston upon Hull , he trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art , but his studies—and the early stages of his career—were curtailed by the Second World War. After initial success in revue and sketch productions, he was cast by the film producers John and Roy Boulting to star in a series of satires , starting with Private's Progress in 1956 through to I'm All Right Jack in 1959. In the mid-1960s he played Bertie Wooster for BBC Television for which he received positive reviews, including from P.&#160;G. Wodehouse , the writer who created the character of Wooster. In the early 1970s he played another upper-class literary character, Lord Peter Wimsey , the amateur but talented investigator created by Dorothy L. Sayers . Carmichael was often typecast as an affable but bumbling upper-class innocent, but he retained a disciplined approach to training and rehearsing.

Built in the Ionic order , it is the best-known structure and symbol of pre-Christian Armenia . It has been described as the "easternmost building of the Greco-Roman world " and the only largely preserved Hellenistic building in the former Soviet Union . It is conventionally identified as a pagan temple built by King Tiridates&#160;I in the first century AD as a temple to the sun god Mihr ( Mithra ). It collapsed in a 1679 earthquake , but much of its fragments remained on the site. Renewed interest in the 19th century led to excavations in the early and mid-20th century. It was reconstructed in 1969–75, using the anastylosis technique. It is one of the main tourist attractions in Armenia and the central shrine of Hetanism (Armenian neopaganism). This aerial photograph shows the Garni Temple in the winter.

Thats not what I meant tho, the point about books is that they store information reliably. If I write something down, within most reasonable settings it will still be the same text when I read it back. That means if I write something down instead of remembering it, the writing will outperform me in storing this information. Same with the calculator, the calculator will always perform at least as good as me at arithmetics. There is no calculation on which the calculator can randomly fail, leading me to do it by hand, so I don&#x27;t need to retain the skill of doing it by hand.

Balance-wise. One can solve problems across a broad range of topics equally well. Tailoring a language to make some tasks especially easy &#x2F; straightforward will likely make some other problems a lot harder &#x2F; more cumbersome to express. So further improvements in abstraction and expressiveness have to come from elsewhere. Not better programming languages but partnering up with an LLM? prmoustache 1 minute ago | parent | context | on: Honda conducts successful launch and landing of ex...

A decade ago, a small in-house test group would run its manual scripts after the developers finished coding. That world has disappeared. Release cycles are shorter, customer expectations are higher, and every application now touches cloud services, mobile devices, and regulatory rules. Leadership must decide whether to keep quality assurance entirely inside the company walls, hire freelance specialists, or partner with a full-service firm that offers a broad bench of expertise. That choice influences cost structure, and time to market. the_real_cher 2 minutes ago | parent | context | on: Sam Altman says Meta offered $100M bonuses to Open...

There’s often good performance or security reasons why it’s hard to get a debugger running in prod, but it’s still worth figuring out how to do it IMO. Your experience sounds more sophisticated than mine, but the one time I was able to get even basic debugger support into a production Ruby app, it made fixing certain classes of bug absolutely trivial compared to what it would have been. The main challenge was getting this considered as a requirement up front rather than after the fact. 0points 2 minutes ago | parent | context | on: Why JPEGs still rule the web (2024) &gt; COBOL Was popular in the 60s in fintech, so banks, ATM:s and related systems went digital using it.

Musk from the beginning realize to reduce the price, he would have to solve re-usabilitly. So he and the company from the beginning was focused on re-usability. He didn&#x27;t just say &#x27;this is what we are gone do&#x27;. As the company grew and solved initial problems of launch, they slowly figured out the best way to do it. And Musk as CEO was deeply involved from the beginning and and involved in all decisions. TrackerFF 4 minutes ago | parent | context | on: Which company would you prefer to join?

That is, if it’s not happening already. I would be very much surprised if there weren’t already tons of people trying SEO and prompt injection techniques to do exactly that. But what really disappoints me and leaves me feeling hopeless for the future is how people like the author are either completely oblivious (or worse, don’t care) about the possibility and probability of such blatant manipulation. fredoralive 5 minutes ago | parent | context | on: Windows x86-64 System Call Table (XP&#x2F;2003&#x2F;Vista&#x2F;7&#x2F;...

Doing the math, even in the worst circumstances (very cold or very hot temperatures) with a 300 mile range battery that you max out at 80% charge and avoid going below 10% charge, I can get back the majority of my commute and even have enough charge to go into the city over 50 miles away on the weekend. I would only need to stop at a level 2 charger every other week or so. 2 weeks if I don’t need to go to the city. My work is nearby a level 2 charger and places in the city even have level 3 charging. And that is worst case scenario getting only 2 miles an hour off a standard wall outlet as opposed to the optimum 4 or 5 miles. I feel far more confident about battery range. The 3-4 trips that are more than 250 miles round trip a year are fine if you plan the route and are okay stopping for half an hour. With kids and a dog a stop in a ICE vehicle could easily take that long anyway. tialaramex 5 minutes ago | parent | context | on: Bzip2 crate switches from C to 100% Rust I wonder what happens in the minds of people who just flatly contradict reality.

README Apache-2.0 license MiniMax-M1 1. Model Overview We introduce MiniMax-M1, the world's first open-weight, large-scale hybrid-attention reasoning model. MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention mechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model , which contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters activated per token. Consistent with MiniMax-Text-01, the M1 model natively supports a context length of 1 million tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning attention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time compute – For example, compared to DeepSeek R1, M1 consumes 25% of the FLOPs at a generation length of 100K tokens. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that require processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems ranging from traditional mathematical reasoning to sandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. We develop an efficient RL scaling framework for M1 highlighting two perspectives: (1) We propose CISPO, a novel algorithm that clips importance sampling weights instead of token updates, which outperforms other competitive RL variants; (2) Our hybrid-attention design naturally enhances the efficiency of RL, where we address unique challenges when scaling RL with the hybrid architecture. We train two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K thinking budgets respectively. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our models outperform other strong open-weight models such as the original DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, particularly on complex software engineering, tool using, and long context tasks. With efficient scaling of test-time compute, MiniMax-M1 serves as a strong foundation for next-generation language model agents to reason and tackle real-world challenges. Benchmark performance comparison of leading commercial and open-weight models across competition-level mathematics, coding, software engineering, agentic tool use, and long-context understanding tasks. We use the MiniMax-M1-80k model here for MiniMax-M1. 2. Evaluation Performance of MiniMax-M1 on core benchmarks.

Our models are evaluated with temperature=1.0 , top_p=0.95 . SWE-bench methodology We report results derived from the Agentless scaffold. Departing from the original pipeline, our methodology employs a two-stage localization process (without any embedding-based retrieval mechanisms): initial coarse-grained file localization followed by fine-grained localization to specific files and code elements. The values for our models are calculated on the subset of n=486 verified tasks which work on our infrastructure. The excluded 14 test cases that were incompatible with our internal infrastructure are: "astropy__astropy-7606" , "astropy__astropy-8707" , "astropy__astropy-8872" , "django__django-10097" , "matplotlib__matplotlib-20488" , "psf__requests-2317" , "psf__requests-2931" , "psf__requests-5414" , "pylint-dev__pylint-6528" , "pylint-dev__pylint-7277" , "sphinx-doc__sphinx-10435" , "sphinx-doc__sphinx-7985" , "sphinx-doc__sphinx-8269" , "sphinx-doc__sphinx-8475" TAU-bench methodology We evaluate TAU-Bench with GPT-4.1 as user model and without any custom tools. The maximum number of interaction steps is 40. Our general system prompt is: - In each round, you need to carefully examine the tools provided to you to determine if any can be used. - You must adhere to all of the policies. Pay attention to the details in the terms. Solutions for most situations can be found within these policies. 3.

Unlike Scrappy (so far as I can tell) CardStock is open-source and can be run locally.[1] Decker[2] (which is also open-source) has answers to several of the things outlined on Scrappy’s roadmap, including facilities for representing and manipulating tabular data with its query language and grid widgets and the ability for users to abstract collections of parts into reusable &quot;Contraptions&quot;.

No installation is required—neither for the developer nor the user. Below is an example of a math practice app with simple user interaction through dialogs. For more complex UIs, CodeBoot provides an FFI for accessing the DOM directly from Python code. To create a web app URL, right-click the &quot;play&quot; button and choose the type of link you want to generate. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.codeboot.org&#x2F;5.3.1&#x2F;?init=.fbWF0aF9wcmFjdGljZS5we... reply tokioyoyo 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] One of the best things that I did was spending a week making a simple app that can put all my Apple Watch walks on a single big map, then sharing it with my friends after it got published on AppStore. It&#x27;s been a year since I worked on it, but I still get messages from my friends (and some random people who found it!) how they&#x27;ve walked through an entire city or something. Really rewarding experience, despite having zero financial gains from it. OP is right, making simple apps for your friends for fun! reply bryantt 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] This sounds great, could you link the app please? reply dewey 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Not the OPs app but there&#x27;s an app doing something similar that I enjoyed for many years, you can also import from GPS trackers and others: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fogofworld.app reply drchaos 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Not OP, but https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dawarich.app&#x2F; seems to do the same (open source and self-hostable, also has an iOS App). reply nilirl 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] It&#x27;s nice but I&#x27;ve yet to see a more usable end-user programming environment than the spreadsheet. reply thunspa 39 minutes ago | parent | next [–] Or learning to actually code. I can&#x27;t see why I would ever learn to use these kinds of tools. As a developer, I can just make it myself. Now with LLMs, if it&#x27;s very simple and bounded, I can just vibe most of it with very little to lose. As a lay person, I don&#x27;t see what the TAM for this is. Who will spend the time to learn how to drag and drop an application? reply selcuka 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] I think &quot;vibe coding&quot; will not replace developers in the short term, but it will be the strongest competition for such simple systems. I asked a few LLMs to make apps like these (plain HTML with embedded JS), and they got it right after a few edits. They are also visually more appealing [1].

I&#x27;ve found that every few hours I get stuck on an issue that the LLM can&#x27;t solve and a user with no programming experience would have little hope to crack it either. I suppose this issue might depend on technology and scope of the project. reply physicsguy 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] It&#x27;s got a bug, if you enter a non-integer like 3 + 2 = 5.1 then it marks that as correct reply melagonster 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] You are right. They are the natural opponents of vibe coding. vibe coding is from a funny X post; this is the OG purpose. reply hiAndrewQuinn 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] You can make an awful lot of useful little tools with an LLM, vanilla JavaScript, GitHub Pages, and the user&#x27;s own localStorage as a semi-persistence layer. Two 9s and cross-platform to boot. Recently I made a diet checklist [1] that I&#x27;ve been following more or less to the letter 5 days out of the week. I have a little Android button that just opens right up to the web page. I click, click, click, then move on with my day. If I feel I need to change something I can copy a plain text screenshot of what&#x27;s on there currently and chat with Gemini about it. I&#x27;m really liking this new wave of technology.

As someone without a deep technical background, LLMs enabled me to improve my life unimaginably, being able to quickly sketch and develop small features that remove every day annoyance. reply fuzztester 16 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] examples? reply riffraff 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] I am 100% behind the idea of &quot;scriptable components&quot; vs block-based programming for beginners. I&#x27;m on mobile now but I&#x27;ll try this on desktop ASAP. But I think one thing missing on the analysis is: people want ease of share and zero cost. It&#x27;s surprisingly simple to build a minimal app in some environments but then you get to distribution (app store are a huge gatekeeper) and&#x2F;or hosting and e.g. my wife or kids won&#x27;t be bothered to pay 5$&#x2F;momth for it (and neither will many professional devs). reply DougN7 3 hours ago | parent | next [–] You could self host with your OS’s web server and a dynamic DNS service pointing to your home computer. reply franga2000 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Except the OS has no web server, so you have to find and install one, make sure it auto starts, set up port forwarding (which you might not be able to if you&#x27;re behind CGNAT or your ISP just doesn&#x27;t let you)... Then you need to explain to your partner that your computer is running 24&#x2F;7 to host your shared shopping list or whatever, which will definitely cost more in electricity than a 5$&#x2F;mo VPS, which was already presumed to be unacceptable reply vincnetas 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &quot;... my wife or kids &quot; you already lost them at &quot;... self host&quot; reply abcd_f 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] GP was suggesting that you would self-host for your wife and kids, not that they would self-host themselves. reply stevoski 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Sadly, free hosting or distribution for fun ideas like this one leads to bad actors abusing the service. reply indyjo 56 minutes ago | prev | next [–] So you drag UI elements onto an empty sheet, fight with the grid snap (because it doesn&#x27;t match the size of your UI elements) and are then supposed to enter raw JavaScript, without any code completion, visual programming, API help or AI support?

Likewise. At least, when someone else did the prompting — I do like what LLMs can output, but when LLM answers are sufficient I prefer to cut out the middle-man and ask the LLM directly myself. reply Hendrikto 20 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] If you read up on hyphens VS en-dashes VS em-dashes, using em-dashes is actually the correct usage — as a separator — in the case you cited. I disagree with your conclusion of this being a telltale sign of being AI generated. reply swyx 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] &gt; All Scrappy apps are multiplayer, like a Google Doc is. You can even edit them while they are being used by someone else! ok where is the scrappy backend? what data do you see? where do i make an account? i wish that this was more transparent&#x2F;discussed since obviously this software is not entirely local? &gt; LLMs are getting better and better, and while they are far from able to make a full-fledged app without a lot of help from a software engineer, they can make small apps pretty reliably. mildly disagree. llm generated apps tend to look better + i dont have to learn or stick to your preset primitives. even nontechnical people run into this pretty quickly otherwise, nice labor of love. good going OP. reply Peteragain 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] I feel we are coming at this as programmers, and the opportunity is the community aspect. What about starting with the family run app stores? Masterson style. No security (you&#x27;re all friends right) and no way to contribute without an invite. Just a thought. reply account-5 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] &gt; You drag objects out on the canvas — a button, a textfield, a few labels. Select an object, and you can modify its attribute in an inspector panel. Certain objects, like buttons, has attributes like “when clicked” that contain javascript code. Swap JavaScript with VBA and this is the MS Access workflow. I&#x27;d only start using this if it became ooensource though, can find anything to suggest it is. reply jackgavigan 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] I love the concept. I think the trick to being successful with a project like this is cracking the user experience in a way that makes it powerful enough to be truly useful, while keeping it simple enough that a child can build (scr)apps (c.f. Super Mario Maker). Making it possible to lookup and store data in a spreadsheet (maybe using something like the Google Sheets API) could unlock a huge amount of use cases. I&#x27;ll be watching this project with interest! reply lastdong 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] Google Studio IO apps seems like a step in the same direction. Now if only we could host it on github and take advantage of static github pages. In the future, optimised open models will enable more people to develop tools locally, and with an open source AIDE (does this term exist yet? Artificial Intelligence Development Environment) publish &#x2F; share it in different ways. reply filcuk 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] Just trying this out and it appears in Firefox, the drag &amp; drop handle on new elements doesn&#x27;t cover the whole rectangle, just the label. reply threemux 29 minutes ago | prev | next [–] See also: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.robinsloan.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;home-cooked-app&#x2F; reply s_ting765 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] Cool but no link for the source code negates entire point of sharing apps. reply abcd_f 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] It absolutely doesn&#x27;t. reply DustinEgg 43 minutes ago | prev | next [–] A very good idea. reply jayd16 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] I guess this fits into the Google Forms, SharePoint space? reply croniev 4 hours ago | prev | next [–] I like the idea! Now you&#x27;re just left with the dilemma of what happens when you reach many people with it - will Scrappy be made for thousands of users, polished and flashy? reply atemerev 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] So, just like Delphi?

Delphi was one of my earliest programming experiences in the 90s.

https://pontus.granstrom.me/scrappy/|Scrappy: make little apps for you and your friends|Scrappy: make little apps for you and your friends Scrappy make little apps for you and your friends John Chang and Pontus Granström May 16, 2025 19 min read Software is important to people. Most of us spend our workdays in front of computers. We use the computer in our pocket tens if not hundreds of times every day. The apps we use are almost exclusively mass-market, sold on an app-store, made for thousands if not millions of users. Or they are enterprise apps that are custom-built for hundreds of thousands of dollars. But there isn’t really any equivalent of home-made software — apps made lovingly by you for your friends and family. Apps that aren’t polished or flashy, but are made to your preference and help you with your particular needs. We’re John and Pontus, and we’ve been exploring the potential of home-made software together. We ended up creating a research prototype that we call Scrappy — a tool for making scrappy apps for just you and your friends. First and foremost, we aim to contribute a vision of what home-made software could be like. We want to make this vision as concrete as we can, by sharing a working tool and examples of apps made in it. Scrappy, in its current state, is a prototype, not a robust tool, but we hope it paints the picture we carry in our heads — of software as something that can be creative, personal, expressive. Made by anyone, for themselves and their loved ones. What is Scrappy? It may not be clear what “a scrappy app for you and your friends” means. What kind of apps are these? Let us paint a picture with a few examples. (We call them “ Scrapps ”.) Arithmetic practice for a kid in elementary school. When outgrown, the Scrapp can be extended with harder problems. ( try on desktop ) Attendee counter for a local event. The counter’s state is shared, so the Scrapp can be used to let people in and out at multiple entrances. ( try on desktop ) Meeting cost clock, to help meetings stay on track. A Scrapp like this can be put together in 15 minutes and shared with coworkers right away. ( try on desktop ) Weekly chore tracker. Let roommates flexibly swap weeks, while making sure to track whose up next, to keep things fair. ( try on desktop ) What is it like to make an app in Scrappy? Scrappy is an infinite canvas of interactive objects. The workflow is similar to an app such as Figma, Miro, or Google Slides — except you can attach behaviors to the objects. You drag objects out on the canvas — a button, a textfield, a few labels. Select an object, and you can modify its attribute in an inspector panel. Certain objects, like buttons, has attributes like “when clicked” that contain javascript code. When the button is clicked, that code is run — maybe it records the contents of the textfield to a label that acts as a log. You build your app step by step: tweaking and rearranging the objects, and attaching a little bit of code to them. There’s no better way to get a feeling for an authoring environment than to see someone use it in action. In the following videos, I’m making an attendee counter for an event. The basics. I start out by adding a number field to track the number of attendees, and two buttons for recording people entering and exiting the venue. Your browser cannot play this video. Reactive formulas. Next, I add a field for the venue’s capacity, and a warning when too many people have been let in. I use a reactive formula to control the visibility of the warning and the border color of the field. Your browser cannot play this video. A shared, persistent world. Without any extra work, Scrappy apps are multiplayer. App state is persisted and synced, like users expect from online documents like Google Sheets or Figma. Your browser cannot play this video. The app is always live. There’s no distinction between editing and running. I can edit the app while a friend is using it. Your browser cannot play this video. Selective sharing. I make a variant of the app that’s limited to only entering and exiting people. This is done by putting a part of the app in a frame, and sharing only that frame. The limited version is still linked to the main app. Your browser cannot play this video. Visible, tangible data. Here’s what the Meeting Cost Clock app shown above looks like when zoomed out, revealing a common pattern in Scrapps. Outside the shared frame are a bunch of fields used to compute the cost of the meeting. This lets me see the data while I’m working on the Scrapp, just like in a spreadsheet, which is very helpful for debugging — and it makes future tweaking or remixing easier. Why make Scrappy? This project is driven by a desire to reimagine software creation and use. As part of a growing movement variously termed “ small computing ,” “ casual programming ”, and “ home-cooked software ” we want to emancipate end-users — to “empower people to express themselves without requiring them to be heavy-duty programmers,” to “liberate the programming of computers from the priesthood to the layperson”, as Bill Atkinson worded it. We want to shift the world away from mass-market, industrially-produced software toward more personal, even disposable, tools that are designed for and readily modified and adapted to specific social contexts . Above all, we want to foster a sense of agency and to ultimately contribute to &ldquo; redistributing the means of software production &rdquo;. We were inspired by the simplicity of tools like Notion , tldraw , and mmm.page , but wanted to empower people with richer interactivity and programming capabilities. However, knowing the strengths and limitations of the standard visual programming paradigms of blocks (e.g. Scratch , Blockly ) and nodes-and-wires (e.g. Max/MSP , Node-RED , natto , Holograph ), we deliberately wanted to go down a different path. Instead, we drew direct inspiration from “media with scripting” environments, both classic systems like HyperCard , Visual Basic , and Macromedia Director , as well as contemporary platforms like Dynamicland and Minecraft , where the “media with scripting” exist in a shared online world. Overall, our target user experience was that of a productivity tool, specifically a canvas-based tool (e.g. Figma , Miro , and tldraw )—rather than programming environments (e.g. Squeak/Smalltalk , modern IDEs) and website and app builders (e.g. Squarespace , mmm.page , Bubble ). And we also wanted that kind of modern “share link”-based real-time collaboration popularized by Google Docs and Figma . Finally, while we acknowledge the capabilities of AI-centric systems that leverage LLMs for code generation (e.g., Lovable , bolt.new , and tldraw computer ), we deliberately chose to focus our design on direct manipulation and user control. Who is Scrappy for? As we were prototyping, it wasn’t clear who the ideal user for Scrappy was. We left this open, to see what we’d learn from building the system. Eventually, a few potential personas revealed themselves. The process optimizer. In business environments, there’s always some improvement that can be made using software. But the person who sees the process inefficiency likely can’t make software themselves, and involving a professional programmer is expensive. So what usually happens is they make what improvements they can using tools they are familiar with, such as Excel. Here Scrappy could be a more powerful and flexible Excel, while retaining familiarity and ease of use. Teachers and students . Teaching programming requires teaching a multitude of inessential technical details: how to use the command line, how file systems work, how to set up the environment, dependency management, version control, servers and clients, and on and on. With Scrappy, you can just create a button, write a line of code and click the button to run the code. Ourselves! We are professional programmers who don’t like programming. Why? Because of the all the aforementioned complexity that adds friction to what could be so much simpler. When making mass-market apps, we know we have to deal with that complexity, but when working on a fun hobby project?! Give us a break. Scrappy is that kind of break. The DIYer. People like to customize their house, grow their own vegetables, sow their own clothes, build their own furniture. Scrappy is where a DIY-inclined person makes their own little apps for themselves and their friends. As Scrappy solidified, we wanted to focus on one of these personas. There’s a pull toward business use cases, since businesses are the most willing to pay for a product, but we believe the incentives there would lead us too close to existing products like Retool or LiveCode . The teaching use case is compelling, but we believe it needs a better coding experience (discoverability, better error messages, debugger) which was out of scope for us (for now). We are itching to make stuff for ourselves in Scrappy (and we are strong believers in dogfooding), but most of our projects required features that would balloon the scope. The DIYer making home-made software is the least served by existing tools, and fits our vision of democratized computing the best. We decided this is where we could make the biggest contribution (the blue ocean strategy ), and decided to make the DIYer our target persona. Ideally, Scrappy would let anyone with basic computer literacy make a simple app and learn from there. This is not quite the case yet — some JavaScript knowledge is required. So today, the person making Scrapps from scratch is a programmer DIYer. But when a Scrapp is shared with friends, those friends can use it and remix it without needing programming experience. What should I make in Scrappy? Home-made, scrappy apps don’t really exist today, so most people (including us!) are not used to coming up with ideas for them. When faced with a problem that would make a great Scrapp, instead our minds go to “maybe there’s an app for that”, searching the web for one, giving up if we cannot find a good one. To start coming up with good uses for Scrappy requires a shift to a home-made mindset. To help you build that mindset, here is an assortment of ideas for Scrapps (some of which are not feasible in the current prototype of Scrappy, but should be). Custom flashcards Meeting agenda manager Day clock for person with dementia Online workshop facilitation Consulting time tracker Point-based voting for a board Receipt generator Simple word game School grade calculator Interactive visual recipe Social quiz game Typing tutor Lyric writing aids (synonyms, rhymes) Board game helper Wedding RSVP + seating arrangement Dynamic opening hours display Family bulletin board Group travel planner Chore → allowance calculator Chess clock productivity timer What makes a problem well-suited for Scrappy? Here are some things they have in common: Shared with friends. While a Scrapp can be for just yourself, Scrappy really shines with multiples users, leveraging the shared, persistent world. Some problems that would need setting up a backend server can be built in minutes in Scrappy. Needs tweaking-as-you-go. Life changes, and so does requirements. In Scrappy, you can edit the app at any time — even while your friend is using it. No building, no deploying, no fuss. A sprinkle of computation. Scrappy shines when thought of as a shared document first, with a little bit of computation added on top. For complex systems with a lot of moving parts, we recommend reaching for traditional software engineering tools. Minimal friction. We all let out a groan inside whenever we are hit with “create an account to continue”. This “account friction” may not be much, but it multiplies when sharing with a group of people — there’s always going to be someone for whom the friction is too much. Scrapps don’t have this problem: just click the link. Small number of trusted users. Scrappy assumes you trust the people you share a Scrapp with, which removes a lot of friction, but if you need to control access and permissions, look elsewhere. Not mission-critical. If you need guaranteed correctness or perfect control over details, don’t reach for Scrappy. Those qualities are what you pay expert engineers for. Scrappy vs mass-market apps When faced with a “scrappy” problem — something small that would benefit from a computer — most people will think “maybe there’s an app for that”, followed by searching an app store or the Internet to look for one. If there is no app for that, or there’s no good one, you could make your own in Scrappy. We hope you do! But often there is an app for that. If there is, it will probably be more polished than anything you can make in Scrappy. In this case, there are still reasons to consider using making your own Scrapp: Does exactly what you need. And only what you need. Nothing more, nothing less. Home-made with love. Scrapps are made by you for your friends. A home-knitted sweater will always mean more to you than a store-bought one. Fun and playful. In Scrappy, it’s easy to play around. Tweak the colors, make a cute layout, add little inside jokes. Remixable. Easy to share with others and modify to suit your needs. Collaborative by default. All Scrappy apps are multiplayer, like a Google Doc is. You can even edit them while they are being used by someone else! No accounts and signups. If you share a Scrappy app with someone, they can start using it right away — no tedious sign-up flows stopping your friends or family from joining in. You own your data. The data is stored locally and will only be used for nefarious purposes if its creator (you) wants to! Scrappy vs AI-written apps What about asking an LLM to make a custom, home-made app? LLMs are getting better and better, and while they are far from able to make a full-fledged app without a lot of help from a software engineer, they can make small apps pretty reliably. So if I can ask ChatGPT or Claude to make an app, why would I use Scrappy? Scrappy is understandable. Using an LLM means going from an English prompt to pages of React code, which is too big a leap for non-programmers. They end up having to rely on the LLM to make changes, and are left helpless if the LLM doesn’t do the right thing. In contrast, Scrappy’s objects-on-a-canvas model is easy to understand, more humane, and acts a shared substrate where user and AI can collaborate on equal footing. And because it is less overwhelming, it’s more likely the user will pick up some programming skills. Scrappy is collaborative. All Scrappy apps are little shared worlds, persistent and with live updating — all for free. LLMs are mainly useful for creating static front-end-only web apps. And in Scrappy, apps can be edited by multiple users in realtime, whereas AI workflows are mostly “type, then wait” with little room for collaboration between humans. Scrappy is more fun! While typing a few sentences of English and seeing a full app appear out of nowhere still feels like magic, it quickly grows old when you’re waiting for minutes only to see the LLM misunderstood you again. In Scrappy, there is joy in tweaking things or remixing something. A spark of “ooh I want it to do this” and it’s only a few clicks and keystrokes away. A sense of creative ownership. And you can edit it together with friends! Scrappy vs HyperCard (and its successors) HyperCard was popular among Macintosh users in the early 90s, and is often held as an exemplar of enabling home-made software and end-user programming. Decades later, there have been a number of successors to HyperCard, both commercial ( HyperStudio , SuperCard , LiveCode ) and non-commercial ( Decker and WildCard , among a number of open-source remakes, most of which are abandonware). Most of these have been quite literal replicas of HyperCard, driven by nostalgia, down to the black-and-white graphics. None have been as successful as the original. We wanted to create something in the spirit of HyperCard, rather than recreate HyperCard. Scrappy is different from HyperCard and its direct descendants in a few key ways: Designed for the Internet. Scrappy apps are easily shareable online with a simple link, whereas using HyperCard and most of its descendants is like being trapped in a virtual machine. A shared world. HyperCard stacks could be shared as a file with other users. Scrappy takes this to the next level by letting users edit and use apps at the same time. Modern UI conventions. Scrappy apps live on a high-resolution infinite canvas, with selections, copying, panning and zooming, frames for grouping, etc. Uses JavaScript for scripting. HyperCard and a number of its descendants use programming languages that aren’t in common use. JavaScript is the most common programming language in the world, is native to the Web and works well for a dynamic environment such as Scrappy. A larger palette of interactive objects. Many HyperCard-likes only support a few elements like buttons, text fields, and images. Scrappy supports more UI elements like sliders and timers, but also data types beyond strings: numbers, dates, and compound JSON objects. Reactive formulas, like a spreadsheet. The idea of “this value changes when that value changes” is familiar to many, and can be a stepping stone toward event-based programming, where the user has to think about state. Future directions With our prototype, we think that we&rsquo;ve been successful at proving the ideas and design principles that we started with. But there&rsquo;s a lot more work to do. The number of Scrapps that can be built in a way that feel “Scrappy native” is still low. Much of the time, existing knowledge of JavaScript is required. To improve this, we need to continue work in both &ldquo;lowering the floor&rdquo; and &ldquo;raising the ceiling&rdquo;. Lowering the floor means making things more friendly and approachable for people with little or no programming experience. For example: Improve code discoverability. We’ve made coding easier by presenting the names of objects visually on the screen, and listing their methods in the properties panel. But there&rsquo;s a ton more than we can do. You should be able to click on objects to discover their methods and insert them in the code. Available names should auto-complete so you don&rsquo;t have remember syntax and do as much typing. Improve debugging. You should be able to visualize relationships between objects, perhaps as arrows showing which objects read or modify other objects. Error messages should be better worded and show more information about what went wrong. You should be able pause and rewind execution. All of this while live collaborating on the app with a friend. Leverage AI. As we mentioned earlier , we don’t believe in having an LLM make an entire app, but we are interested in having it act as an assistant, directed by the user. Maybe you’d click on the canvas and ask the AI to “make start and stop buttons here”, or go to a text label’s “when changed” handler and ask the AI to write code to “show an error message if using non-english characters”. Make it even easier to share and remix . It&rsquo;s easier to learn by inspecting and tweaking other people&rsquo; work than it is to start from a blank canvas. We imagine a public gallery where users can publish their creations, and other users can adopt and customize them for their own needs and preferences. Make Scrapps work well on phones/tablets. A hand-sized touchscreen is too small for editing Scrapps comfortably, but using them on phones should work well — this is not currently the case. The infinite canvas paradigm means that objects have fixed positions, which is a way simpler mental model layout rules (like in CSS), but means designs aren’t responsive to screen size. However, drag-and-drop web page design tools like mmm.page and Squarespace show a way to handle this: simply show safe areas for mobile to the user. Raising the ceiling means adding functionality and expressive power, letting users create more things with less effort. For example: Add support for collections . Currently, you can edit and store strings, numbers, dates, and JSON data, but you cannot store lists of them or make an editable tables, like in a spreadsheet. We also don&rsquo;t have any kind of layout containers, like lists, grids, or stacks. Adding this would let authors express more things visually, and they wouldn’t have to resort to JavaScript knowledge and hidden state. Instanced frames. Frames let you selectively share parts of your app, but that frame is fully synced in real-time across users. This is desirable in some cases and undesirable in others. For example, when sharing a form, each user should only see and edit their own copy. You should be able to share instances of the form, that still collects all the data in one place. Another example is a board game helper where there’s some hidden information and users should see some shared UI and some UI only visible to them. Tools for data processing. We’ve found ourselves wanting to use Scrappy to process tabular data. Things like: do the same operations to all rows, filter the table based on some criteria, etc. This can be done in JavaScript, but there should be a Scrappy-native way of doing this, where the data is shown. Better support for reuse. Currently, if you want to repeat an object or set of objects in your Scrapp, you have to manually edit them one by one, or write code to manage them. Instead, you should be able to define a reusable component and make instances that stay linked to the main component. Figma has this, PowerPoint has slide masters, HyperCard has card backgrounds, all to this effect. Further, these components could be shared across projects, or even with other users. Allow extending Scrappy. Some capabilities will be out of reach using Scrappy’s primitives. Currently, we are the only ones able to add new objects, but we’d want to open this up to more people. We expect this would require programming and web expertise, so it wouldn’t be something for a traditional engineer, not the typical Scrappy user. Clean up the conceptual model. Currently, some of the objects store data values, and some support event handlers like &ldquo;when clicked&rdquo; and &ldquo;when changed&rdquo; handlers. The current implementation is a bit arbitrary about this, which is not only confusing but also limiting. Common behaviors like editing, clicking, and storing data should be made more consistent and freely “mixable” — like the entity component systems of game engines like Unity . Conclusion We believe computers should work for people, and dream of a future where computing, like cooking or word processing, is available to everyone. Where you can solve your own small, unique problems with small, unique apps. Where you don’t just rely on mass-market apps made by expert programmers. Where you share home-made little apps with family and friends. Scrappy is our contribution to this dream. Each Scrapp is a live, persistent world, easily shared and remixed, closer to familiar productivity apps than alien developer tools. Like any vision, ours is incomplete, but we’ve grounded our explorations in a working prototype with examples of apps. Try Scrappy! (desktop only) We hope Scrappy will inspire you to further chase this particular windmill.

Almost everyone in the real world (at least in web tech) seems to do print statement debugging. I have tried and failed to get others interested in using my workflow. I generally agree that it’s the best way to start understanding a system. Breaking on an interesting line of code during a test run and studying the call stack that got me there is infinitely easier than trying to run the code forwards in my head. Young grugs: learning this skill is a minor superpower. Take the time to get it working on your codebase, if you can. reply demosthanos 9 hours ago | parent | next [–] There was a good discussion on this topic years ago [0]. The top comment shares this quote from Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike, neither of whom I&#x27;d call a young grug: &gt; As personal choice, we tend not to use debuggers beyond getting a stack trace or the value of a variable or two. One reason is that it is easy to get lost in details of complicated data structures and control flow; we find stepping through a program less productive than thinking harder and adding output statements and self-checking code at critical places. Clicking over statements takes longer than scanning the output of judiciously-placed displays. It takes less time to decide where to put print statements than to single-step to the critical section of code, even assuming we know where that is. More important, debugging statements stay with the program; debugging sessions are transient. I tend to agree with them on this. For almost all of the work that I do, this hypothesis-logs-exec loop gets me to the answer substantially faster. I&#x27;m not &quot;trying to run the code forwards in my head&quot;. I already have a working model for the way that the code runs, I know what output I expect to see if the program is behaving according to that model, and I can usually quickly intuit what is actually happening based on the incorrect output from the prints.

But the number of times I have found pathological behaviour from just stepping through the code is many. Think &quot;holy f**, this bit of code is running 100 times??&quot; type stuff. With complex event-driven code written by many teams, it&#x27;s not obvious what is happening at runtime by just perusing the code and stroking one&#x27;s long wizard beard. reply johnfn 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] On the other hand, John Carmack loves debuggers - he talks about the importance of knowing your debugging tools and using them to step through a complex system in his interview with Lex Friedman. I think it&#x27;s fair to say that there&#x27;s some nuance to the conversation. My guess is that: - Debuggers are most useful when you have a very poor understanding of the problem domain. Maybe you just joined a new company or are exploring an area of the code for the first time. In that case you can pick up a lot of information quickly with a debugger. - Print debugging is most useful when you understand the code quite well, and are pretty sure you&#x27;ve got an idea of where the problem lies. In that case, a few judicious print statements can quickly illuminate things and get you back to what you were doing. reply 4hg4ufxhy 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It depends on the domain. Any complex long lived mutable state, precise memory management or visual rendering probably benefits from debuggers. Most people who work on crud services do not see any benefit from it, as there is practically nothing going on. Observing input, outputs and databases is usually enough, and when it&#x27;s not a well placed log will suffice. Debuggers will also not help you in distributed environments, which are quite common with microservices. reply BlackFly 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Debuggers absolutely help in distributed environments, in the exact same way that they help with multithreaded debugging of a single process. It is certainly requires a little bit more setup, but there isn&#x27;t some essential aspect of a distributed environment that precludes the techniques of a debugger. The only real issue in debugging a distributed&#x2F;multithreaded environment is that frequently there is a timeout somewhere that is going to kill one of the threads that you may have wanted to continue stepping through after debugging a different thread. reply _heimdall 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This hasn&#x27;t been my experience. When I&#x27;m unfamiliar with a codebase, or unfamiliar with a particular corner of the code, I find myself reaching for console debugging. Its a bit of a scattershot approach, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m looking for so I console log variables in the vicinity. Once I know a codebase I want to debug line by line, walking through to see where the execution deviates from what I expected. I very frequently lean on conditional breakpoints - I know I can skip breaks until a certain condition is met, at which point I need to see exactly what goes wrong. reply nc0 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You also have to remember the context. First that visual debugging was still small and niche, probably not suited to the environment at Bell Labs at the time, given they were working with simpler hardware that might not provide an acceptable graphical environment (which can be seen as a lot of the UNIX system is oriented around the manipulation of lines of text). This is different from the workplace where most game developers, including J. Carmack were, with access to powerful graphical workstations and development tools. Secondly there’s also a difference on the kind of work achieved: the work on UNIX systems mostly was about writing tools than big systems, favoring composition of these utilities. And indeed, I often find people working on batch tools not using visual debuggers since the integration of tools pretty much is a problem of data structure visualization (the flow being pretty linear), which is still cumbersome to do in graphical debuggers. The trend often is inverted when working on interactive systems where the main problem actually is understanding the control flow than visualizing data structures: I see a lot more of debuggers used. Also to keep in mind that a lot of engineers today work on Linux boxes, which has yet to have acceptable graphical debuggers compared to what is offered in Visual Studio or XCode. reply tcoff91 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Adding print statements sucks when you are working on native apps and you have to wait for the compiler and linker every time you add one. Debuggers hands down if you are working on something like C++ or Rust. You can add tracepoints in your debugger if you want to do print debugging in native code. In scripting languages print debugging makes sense especially when debugging a distributed system. Also logging works better than breaking when debugging multithreading issues imo. I use both methods. reply mort96 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] How long are you realistically &quot;waiting for the compiler and linker&quot;? 3 seconds?

I&#x27;ve worked on projects where incremental linking after touching the wrong .cpp file will take several minutes... and this is after I&#x27;ve optimized link times from e.g. switching from BFD to Gold, whereas before it might take 30 minutes. A full build (from e.g. touching the wrong header ) is measured in hours. And that&#x27;s for a single configuration x platform combination, and I&#x27;m often the sort to work on the multi-platform abstractions, meaning I have it even worse than that. &gt; If I wanna use a debugger though, now that means a full recompile to build the project without optimizations You can use debuggers on optimized builds, and in fact I use debuggers on optimized builds more frequently than I do unoptimized builds. Granted, to make sense of some of the undefined behavior heisenbugs you&#x27;ll have to understand disassembly, and dig into the lower level details when the high level ones are unavailable or confused by optimization, but those are learnable skills. It&#x27;s also possible to turn off optimizations on a per-module basis with pragmas, although then you&#x27;re back into incremental build territory. reply draven 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I work on Scala projects. Adding a log means stopping the service, recompiling and restarting. For projects using Play (the biggest one is one of them) that means waiting for the hot-reload to complete. In both cases it easily takes at least 30s on the smallest projects, with a fast machine. With my previous machine Play&#x27;s hot reload on our biggest app could take 1 to 3mn. I use the debugger in Intellij, using breakpoints which only log some context and do not stop the current thread. I can add &#x2F; remove them without recompiling. There&#x27;s no interruption in my flow (thus no excuse to check HN because &quot;compiling...&quot;) When I show this to colleagues they think it&#x27;s really cool.

Usually I can pretty quickly figure out how to garden hose a bunch of print statements everywhere in a completely unfamiliar domain and language. But the debugger is essential for all the hard stuff.

For Carmack, managing the code of others the debug environment is their safe space. For Kernighan et al in the role of progenitorous developer it is the code itself that is the safe space. reply josephg 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] There&#x27;s another story I heard once from Rob Pike about debugging. (And this was many years ago - I hope I get the details right). He said that him and Brian K would pair while debugging. As Rob Pike told it, he would often drive the computer, putting in print statements, rerunning the program and so on. Brian Kernighan would stand behind him and quietly just think about the bug and the output the program was generating. Apparently Brian K would often just - after being silent for awhile - say &quot;oh, I think the bug is in this function, on this line&quot; and sure enough, there it was. Apparently it happened so often enough that he thought Brian might have figured out more bugs than Rob did, even without his hands touching the keyboard. Personally I love a good debugger. But I still think about that from time to time.

I also do quite a lot with print debugging, but some of the most pernicious problems often require a debugger. &gt; It takes less time to decide where to put print statements than to single-step to the critical section of code Why would you ever be single-stepping? Put a break point (conditional if necessary) where you would put the print statement. The difference between a single break point and a print statement is that the break point will allow you to inspect the local variables associated with all calls in the stack trace and evaluate further expressions. So when do you debug instead of using print statements? When you know that no matter what the outcome of your hypothesis is, that you will need to iteratively inspect details from other points up the stack. That is, when you know, from experience, that you are going to need further print statements but you don&#x27;t know where they will be. reply jemmyw 16 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I personally use both, and I&#x27;m not sure I find the argument about needing to step through convincing. I put the debugger breakpoint at the same place I might put a print. I hardly ever step through, but I do often continue to reach this line again. The real advantage is that you can inspect the current state live and make calls with the data. However, I use prints a lot more because you can, as you say, usually get to the answer faster. reply samsepi01 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] But can&#x27;t you instead just set a breakpoint next to wherever you are gonna put that print stmt and inspect value once code hits? print stmt seems like extra overhead reply teaearlgraycold 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That doesn’t necessarily give you a clean log to review reply piva00 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] While also avoiding having to re-run cases to get new introspection when you forgot to add a print statement.

But that probably won&#x27;t coincide with debugging print statements...) reply demosthanos 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] True, but then you&#x27;re still left stepping through your breakpoints one by one. Printf debugging gives you the full picture of an entire execution at a glance, allowing you to see time as it happened. The debugger restricts you to step through time and hold the evolution of state in your memory in exchange for giving you free access to explore the state at each point. Occasionally that arbitrary access is useful, but more often than not it&#x27;s the evolution of state that you&#x27;re interested in, and printf gives you that for free. reply TeMPOraL 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You can use tracepoints instead of breakpoints, or (easier, at least for me), set up breakpoints to execute &quot;print stack frame, continue&quot; when hit - giving you the equivalent of printf debugging, but one you can add&#x2F;remove without recompiling (or even at runtime) and can give you more information for less typing. And, should this help you spot the problem, you can easily add another breakpoint or convert one of the &quot;printing&quot; ones so it stops instead of continuing. And of course, should the problem you&#x27;re debugging be throwing exceptions or crashing the app, the debugger can pause the world at that moment for you, and you get the benefit of debugging and having a &quot;printf log&quot; of the same execution already available. reply Gibbon1 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I set a break point, look at the variables in play and then start looking up the call stack. reply Jensson 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] But that is still slow compared to print debugging if there is a lot happening. Print debugging you can just print out everything that happens and then scan for the issue and you have a nice timeline of what happens after and before in the print statements. I don&#x27;t think you can achieve the same result using debuggers, they just stop you there and you have no context how you got there or what happens after. Maybe some people just aren&#x27;t good at print debugging, but usually it finds the issue faster for me, since it helps pinpointing where the issue started by giving you a timeline of events. Edit: And you can see the result of debugger use in this article, under &quot;Expression Complexity&quot; he rewrote the code to be easier to see in a debugger because he wanted to see the past values. That makes the code worse just to fit a debugger, so it also has such problems. When I use a debugger I do the same, it makes the code harder to read but easier to see in a debugger. reply MangoToupe 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; Takes less time to put a breakpoint then to add (and later remove) temporary print statements Temporary? Nah, you leave them in as debug or trace log statements. It&#x27;s an investment. Shipping breakpoints to a teammate for a problem you solved three months ago is a tedious and time-consuming task. Anyway, breakpoints are themselves quite tedious to interact with iterative problem solving. At least if you&#x27;re familiar with the codebase. reply edanm 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This depends on a lot of things. For example, one thing you wrote that jumps out at me: &gt; I already have a working model for the way that the code runs [...] This is not always true. It&#x27;s only true for code that I wrote or know very well. E.g. as a consultant, I often work on codebases that are new to me, and I do tend to use debuggers there more often than I use print debugging. Although lots of other variables affect this - how much complicated state there is to get things running, how fast the &quot;system&quot; starts up, what language it&#x27;s written in and if there are alternatives (in some situations I&#x27;ll use a Jupyter Notebook for exploring the code, Clojure has its own repl-based way of doing things, etc). reply winrid 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] There&#x27;s this idea that the way you use a debugger is by stepping over line after line during execution. That&#x27;s not usually the case. Setting conditional breakpoints, especially for things like break on all exceptions, or when the video buffer has a certain pattern, etc, is usually where the value starts to come in. reply kapildev 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Exactly, these judiciously placed print statements help me locate the site of the error much faster than using a debugger.

Let the machine do the work! reply ay 12 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] There might be another factor at not using the debugger beyond the pure cluelessness: often you can’t really run it in production. Back when I started with coding (it was Turbo Pascal 3.0, so you get the idea :-), I enjoyed the use of the debugger quite a lot. But in 2000 I started working in a role which required understanding the misbehavior of embedded systems that were forwarding the live traffic, there was a technical possibility to do “target remote …” but almost never an option to stop a box that is forwarding the traffic. So you end up being dependent on debugs - and very occasional debug images with enhanced artisanal diagnostics code (the most fun was using gcc’s -finstrument-function to catch a memory corruption of an IPSec field by an unrelated IKE code in a use-after free scenario) Where the GDB shined though is the analysis of the crash dumps. Implementing a “fake” gdb stub in Perl, which was sucking in the crash dump data and allow to leisurely explore it with debugger rather than decoding hex by hand, was a huge productivity boon. So I would say - it’s better to have more than one tool in the toolbox and use the most appropriate one. reply leojfc 3 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Wholeheartedly agree. There’s often good performance or security reasons why it’s hard to get a debugger running in prod, but it’s still worth figuring out how to do it IMO. Your experience sounds more sophisticated than mine, but the one time I was able to get even basic debugger support into a production Ruby app, it made fixing certain classes of bug absolutely trivial compared to what it would have been.

Even working collaboratively with people they&#x27;d have no concept of how to use a debugger. &quot;No, set a breakpoint there&quot; &quot;yeah now step into the function and inspect the state of those variables&quot; &quot;step over that&quot; : blank stares at each instance : reply roncesvalles 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I&#x27;d love to use a real debugger but as someone who has only ever worked at large companies, this was just never an option. In a microservices mesh architecture, you can&#x27;t really run anything locally at all, and the test environment is often not configured to allow hooking up a stepping debugger. Print debugging is all you have. If there&#x27;s a problem with the logging system itself or something that crashes the program before the logs can flush, then not even that. reply alisonatwork 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This is basically it. When I started programming in C, I used a debugger all the time. Even a bit later doing Java monoliths I could spin up the whole app on my local and debug in the IDE. But nowadays running a dozen processes and containers and whatnot, it&#x27;s just hopeless.

This approach is very easy to get started with and maintain, and provides powerful insight into problems as they arise. I also put a lot of work into formatting log statements. I once worked on a distributed system, and getting the prefix of each log statement exactly right was very useful -- node id, pid, timestamp, all of it fixed width.

The problem is that if you only log problems or &quot;important&quot; things, then you have a selection bias in the log and don&#x27;t have a reference of how the log looks like when the system operates normally.

Also, you did not address the non-trivial cost implications of voluminous log output. &gt; You touch on this, but it&#x27;s a bit strange to me that the default case is assumed to be &quot;all logs all the time&quot;. Regarding the above, production-ready logging libraries such as Logback[0], log4net[1], log4cpp[2], et al, allow for run-time configuration to determine what &quot;areas&quot; will have their entries emitted. So &quot;all logs all the time&quot; is a non sequitur in this context. What is relevant is the technique identified of emitting execution context when it matters and not when it doesn&#x27;t. As to your `npm` example, I believe this falls under the scenario I explicitly identified thusly: ... an &quot;unconditionally emit trace logs&quot; environment (such as local unit&#x2F;integration tests). 0 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;logback.qos.ch&#x2F; 1 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;logging.apache.org&#x2F;log4net&#x2F;index.html 2 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;log4cpp.sourceforge.net&#x2F; reply strken 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I understand that you explained some exceptions to the rule, but I disagree with two things: the assumption of incompetence on the part of geophile to not make logging conditional in some way, and adding the label of &quot;anti-pattern&quot; to something that&#x27;s evidently got so much nuance to it. &gt; the non-trivial cost implications of voluminous log output If log output is conditional at compile time there are no non-trivial cost implications, and even at runtime the costs are often trivial. reply AdieuToLogic 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; ...

Cloud deployment requires transmission of log entries to one or more log aggregators in order to be known. By definition, this involves network I&#x2F;O. Network communication is orders of magnitude slower than local I&#x2F;O. Useless logging of &quot;function entry&#x2F;exit, with param values&quot; increases pressure on network I&#x2F;O. Unless logging is allowed to be lossy, which it never is, transmission must be completed when log buffers are near full capacity. Provisioning production systems having excessive logging can often require more resources than those which do not excessively log. Thus disproving: &gt; ... even at runtime the costs are often trivial. When considering the implication of voluminous log output in a production environment. reply strken 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] As I said, conditional . As in, you add logging to your code but you either remove it at compile time or you check your config at run time. By definition, work you don&#x27;t do is not done. reply TeMPOraL 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Conditionals aren&#x27;t free either, and conditionals - especially compile-time - on logging code are considered by some a bugprone anti-pattern as well. The code that computes data for and assembles your log message may end up executing logic that affects the system elsewhere. If you put that code under conditional, your program will behave differently depending on the logging configuration; if you put it outside, you end up wasting potentially substantial amount of work building log messages that never get used. reply strken 12 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] This is getting a bit far into the weeds, but I&#x27;ve found that debug output which is disabled by default in all environments is quite safe. I agree that it would be a problem to leave it turned on in development, testing, or staging environments. TeMPOraL 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I know a lot of people do that in all kinds of software (especially enterprise), still, I can&#x27;t help but notice this is getting close to Greenspunning[0] territory. What you describe is leaving around hand-rolled instrumentation code that conditionally executes expensive reporting actions, which you can toggle on demand between executions. Thing is, this is already all done automatically for you[1] - all you need is the right build flag to prevent optimizing away information about function boundaries, and then you can easily add and remove such instrumentation code on the fly with a debugger . I mean, tracing function entry and exit with params is pretty much the main task of a debugger. In some way, it&#x27;s silly that we end up duplicating this by hand in our own projects. But it goes beyond that; a lot of logging and tracing I see is basically hand-rolling an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of 5% of GDB. Why not accept you need instrumentation in production too, and run everything in a lightweight, non-interactive debugging session? It&#x27;s literally the same thing, just done better, and couple layers of abstraction below your own code, so it&#x27;s more efficient too. -- [0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule [1] - Well, at least in most languages used on the backend, it is.

That reduces much of the benefit off the top. Some IDEs promise to solve that, but I’ve not been impressed thus far. YMMV based on language&#x2F;runtime&#x2F;toolkit of course. This might get added to my wishlist for my next language of choice. reply hobs 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] A log is very different than a debugger though, one tells you what happened, one shows you the entire state and doesn&#x27;t make you assemble it in your head. reply fingerlocks 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] All these print debugging advocates are blowing my mind. Are most people unaware that both lldb and gdb have conditional pass throughout breakpoints with function hooks? In other words, you can create a breakpoint that just prints its location and doesn’t pause execution. You can script this so all function entry&#x2F;exists, or whatever, are logged without touching the code or needing to recompile. You can then bulk toggle these breakpoints, at runtime, so you only see a particular subset when things get interesting. Modifying the code to print stuff will feel barbaric after driving around a fine tuned debugging experience. reply dpkirchner 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I can&#x27;t tell you how many times lldb has failed to hit breakpoints or has dumped me in some library without symbols. This was in Xcode while writing an iOS app, maybe it&#x27;s better in other environments. Print debugging, while not clever or powerful, has never once failed me. reply fingerlocks 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Sometimes the debugserver is flakey, I’ll give you that. But some that also sounds like UI quirks such as ambiguous breakpoints on a function definition with default initialized default values. You can attach lldb without Xcode. Or you can open the lldb terminal in Xcode, pause execution, and inspect the breakpoints manually reply demosthanos 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Your framing makes it sound like the log is worse in some way, but what the log gives you that the debugger makes you assemble in your head is a timeline of when things happen. Being able to see time is a pretty big benefit for most types of software. I can always drop an entire state object into the log if I need it, but the only way for a debugger to approximate what a log can give me is for me to step through a bunch of break points and hold the time stream in my head. The one place where a debugger is straight up better is if I know exactly which unit of code is failing and that unit has complicated logic that is worth stepping through line by line. That&#x27;s what they were designed for, and they&#x27;re very useful for that, but it&#x27;s also not the most common kind of troubleshooting I run into. reply switchbak 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] In the early 2000’s I whipped up a tool to convert log statements into visual swim lanes like the Chrome profiler does.

I&#x27;m not even sure I want to know the entire state, but GDB has a lot of issue with anything but the most basic data structures most of the time, and I always need to explicitly ask for what I want to see by calling things like operator[] (and then hope that the particular operator[] wasn&#x27;t optimized out of the final binary). It&#x27;s not exactly a great experience. reply Cthulhu_ 41 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] It&#x27;s been years since I last used a debugger, but then, it&#x27;s been years since I last worked on code that was complicated enough to warrant it. Which is a good thing! Easily comprehended code that you can reason about without stepping through it is good for grug brain. reply PaulHoule 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I would tend to say that printf debugging is widespread in the Linux-adjacent world because you can&#x27;t trust a visual debugger to actually be working there because of the general brokenness of GUIs in the Linux world. I didn&#x27;t really get into debuggers until (1) I was firmly in Windows, where you expect the GUI to work and the LI to be busted, and (2) I&#x27;d been burned too many times by adding debugging printfs() that got checked into version control and caused trouble. Since then I&#x27;ve had some adventures with CLI debuggers, such as using gdb to debug another gdb, using both jdb and gdb on the same process at the same time to debug a Java&#x2F;C++ system, automating gdb, etc. But there is the thing, as you say, is that there is usually some investment required to get the debugger working for a particular system. With a good IDE I think Junit + debugging gives an experience in Java similar to using the REPL in a language like Python in that you can write some code that is experimental and experiment it, but in this case the code doesn&#x27;t just scroll out of the terminal but ultimately gets checked in as a unit test. reply ses1984 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Debuggers exist in the terminal, in vim, and in emacs. reply bandrami 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Why would you want a GUI debugger? reply PaulHoule 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Can see all your source code while you&#x27;re debugging.

It&#x27;s one point in favor of async, and language that make async debugging easy. And at the very least, you can encapsulate things so they can be debugged separately from the multi threading stuff. If you&#x27;re always using the debugger, you learn to build around it as one of your primary tools for interacting with code, and you notice right away if the debugger can&#x27;t help with something. reply thesz 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] I used to use debugger when I was young - disk space was small, disks were slow and logging was expensive. Now, some 35 years later, I greatly prefer logs. This way I can compare execution paths of different use cases, I can compare outcomes of my changes, etc. I am not confined to a single point of time with tricky manual control as with debugger, I can see them all. To old grugs: learning to execute and rewind code in your head is a major superpower. And it works on any codebase. reply mikepurvis 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The rise of virtualization, containers, microservices, etc has I think contributed to this being more difficult. Even local dev-test loops often have something other than you launching the executable, which can make it challenging to get the debugger attached to it.

It isn&#x27;t always the answer. If a lot is going on logs can be excellent (plus grep or an observability tool) However debugging is an essential tool in the arsenal. If something is behaving oddly even the best REPL can&#x27;t match debugging as a dev loop (maybe lisp excepted). I even miss the ability to move the current execution point back in .NET now I use Go and JS. That is a killer feature. Edit and continue even more so! Then next level is debugging unit tests.

What sold me on debugger is the things you can do with it * See values and eval expressions in calling frames. * Modify the course of execution by eval&#x27;ing a mutating expression. * Set exception breakpoints which stop deep where the exception is raised. One other such tool is REPL. I see REPL and debugger as complementary to each other, and have some success using both together in VSCode, which is pretty convenient with autoreload set.

I really don&#x27;t get this at all. To me it is infinitely easier to iterate and narrow the problem rather than trying to identify sight-unseen where the problem is—it&#x27;s incredibly rare that the bug immediately crashes the program. And you can fit a far higher density of relevant information through print statements over execution of a reproduced bug than you can reproduce at any single point in the call stack. And 99% of the information you can access at any single point in the call stack will be irrelevant. To be sure, a debugger is an incredibly useful and irreplaceable tool.... but it&#x27;s far too slow and buggy to rely on for daily debugging (unless, as you indicate, you don&#x27;t know the codebase well enough to reason about it by reading the code).

But e.g. JavaScript debuggers tend to be fantastic and very fast. In addition, some kinds of systems are very easy to exercise in a debugger, and some are very difficult.

Probably some dev productivity team has already done all the annoying work needed to make the company’s codebase work with some debugger and IDE, so I use that: currently, it’s VS Code and LLDB, which is fine. IntelliJ and jdb at my last job was probably better overall. My workflow is usually: 1. insert a breakpoint on some code that I’m trying to understand 2. attach the debugger and run any tests that I expect to exercise that code 3. walk up and down the call stack, stepping occasionally, reading the code and inspecting the local variables at each level to understand how the hell this thing works and why it’s gone horribly wrong this time. 4. use my new understanding to set new, more relevant breakpoints; repeat 2-4. Sometimes I fiddle with local variables to force different states and see what happens, but I consider this advanced usage, and anyway it often doesn’t work too well on my current codebase. reply btreecat 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I&#x27;ve had more sr devs than I tell me they don&#x27;t see a benefit to using a debugger, because they have a type system.

I think this is correct as an explanation for the phenomenon, but it&#x27;s not just a false perception on their part: for a lot of organizations it is actually true that the only way to preserve boundaries between systems over the course of years is to stick the network in between. Without a network layer enforcing module boundaries code does, in fact, tend to morph into a big ball of mud. I blame a few things for this: 1. Developers almost universally lack discipline. 2. Most programming languages are not designed to sufficiently account for #1. It&#x27;s not a coincidence that microservices became popular shortly after Node.js and Python became the dominant web backend languages. A strong static type system is generally necessary (but not sufficient) to create clear boundaries between modules, and both Python and JavaScript have historically been even worse than usual for dynamic languages when it comes to having a strong modularity story. And while Python and JS have it worse than most, even most of our popular static languages are pretty lousy at giving developers the tools needed to clearly delineate module boundaries. Rust has a pretty decent starting point but it too could stand to be improved. reply arkh 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Developers almost universally lack discipline.

Company structure poorly supports cross-team or department code ownership Many companies don&#x27;t seem to do a good job coordinating between teams. Different teams have different incentives and priorities. If group A needs fixes&#x2F;work from group B and B has been given some other priority, group A is stuck. By putting a network between modules different groups can limit blast damage from other teams&#x27; modules and more clearly show ownership when things go wrong. If group A&#x27;s project fails because of B&#x27;s module it still looks like A&#x27;s code has the problem. Upper management rarely cares about nuance. They want to assign blame, especially if it&#x27;s in another team or department. So teams under them always want clear boundaries of responsibility so they don&#x27;t get thrown under the bus. The root cause of a lot of software problems is the organization that produces it more than any individual or even team working on it. reply closeparen 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The network boundary gives you a factoring tool that most language module systems don&#x27;t: the ability for a collection of packages to cooperate internally but expose only a small API to the rest of the codebase. The fact that it&#x27;s network further disciplines the modules to exchange only data (not callbacks or behaviors) which simplifies programming, and to evolve their interfaces in backwards compatible ways, which makes it possible to &quot;hot reload&quot; different modules at different times without blowing up. You could probably get most of this without the literal network hop, but I haven&#x27;t seen a serious attempt. reply jakewins 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Any language that offers a mechanism for libraries has formal or informal support for defining modules with public APIs?

It just needed to use simple forms, with some simple client side logic for hiding sections, and save the data with an ORM. The funniest bit was when I said that it couldn&#x27;t handle the load because the architecture had obvious bottlenecks. The load was known and fairly trivial (100k form submissions in one month).

The other &quot;senior&quot; database developer asked me what a transaction is. &quot;Oh boy...&quot; [1] Well no, not really , it took about a second, which was long enough for a human button press to to &quot;overlap&quot; the two transactions in time.

The agencies are similarly uncoordinated and will pick up their metaphorical credit card and just throw it at random small dev teams, internally, external, or a mix.

This invariably becomes an argument because the ball of mud the street urchins have sold to the customer is not fit for… anything… certainly not for handling PII or money, but they spent the budget and the status reports were all green ticks for years. Fundamentally, the issue is that they&#x27;re &quot;going into the cloud&quot; with platform as a service, IaC, and everything, but at some level they don&#x27;t fully grok what that means and the type of oversight required to make that work at a reasonable cost. &quot;But the nice sales person from Microsoft assured me the cloud is cheaper!&quot; reply angry_octet 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Omg this is something I have experienced too many times, and constantly warring with the other side of the coin: people who never want to make any change unless it is blessed by a consultant from Microsoft&#x2F;VMWare&#x2F;SAP and then it becomes the only possible course of action, and they get the CIO to sign off on some idiocy that will never work and say &quot;CIO has decreed Project Falcon MUST SUCCEED&quot; when CIO can&#x27;t even tie his shoelaces.

(Example: a monolith can use a queue or a channel, while for microservices you’re going to want Kafka or some other beast.) - Can’t be run locally easily, meaning you need dev environments in cloud, which means more cloud costs. You might even need multiple dev and test environments. That’s even more cloud cost. - Tends to become dependent on the peculiarities of a given cloud host, such as how they do networking, increasing cloud lock in.

Sometimes we&#x27;re right and it does save time--but not always and maybe not often. Three examples: DRY (Don&#x27;t Repeat Yourself) sometimes leads to premature abstraction. We think, &quot;hey, I bet this pattern will get used elsewhere, so we need to abstract out the common parts of the pattern and then...&quot; And that&#x27;s when the Complexity Demon enters. We want as many bugs as possible caught at compile-time. But that means the compiler needs to know more and more about what we&#x27;re actually trying to do, so we come up with increasingly complex types which tax your ability to understand. To avoid boilerplate we create complex macros or entire DSLs to reduce typing. Unfortunately, the Law of Leaky Abstractions means that when we actually need to know the underlying implementation, our head explodes. Our challenge is that each of these examples is sometimes a good idea. But not always. Being able to decide when to introduce complexity to simplify things is, IMHO, the mark of a good software engineer. reply mplanchard 9 hours ago | parent | next [–] For folks who seek a rule of thumb, I’ve found SPoT (single point of truth) a better maxim than DRY: there should be ideally one place where business logic is defined.

To modulate DRY, I try to emphasize the “rule of three”: up to three duplicates of some copy&#x2F;paste code is fine, and after that we should think about abstracting.

Usually I make web applications using Sinatra-like frameworks like Flask or JAXB where I write a function that answers URLs that match a pattern and a &quot;screen&quot; is one or more of those functions that work together and maybe some HTML templates that go with them. For instance there might be a URL for a web page that shows data about a user, and another URL that HTMX calls when you flip a &lt;select&gt; to change the status of that user. Assuming the &quot;application&quot; has the stuff to configure the database connection and file locations and draw HTML headers and footers and such, there is otherwise little coupling between the screens so if you want to make a new screen you can cut and paste an old screen and modify it, or you can ask an LLM to make you a screen or endpoint and if it &quot;vibe coded&quot; you a bad screen you can just try again to make another screen. It can make sense to use inheritance or composition to make a screen that can be specialized, or to write screens that are standalone (other than fetching the db connection and such.) The origin story was that I was working on a framework for making ML training sets called &quot;Themis&quot; that was using microservices, React, Docker and such. The real requirement was that we were (1) always adding new tasks, and (2) having to create simple but always optimized &quot;screens&quot; for those tasks because if you are making 20,000 judgements it is bad enough to click 20,000 times, if you have to click 4x for each one and it adds up to 80,000 you will probably give up. As it was written you had to write a bunch of API endpoints as part of a JAXB application and React components that were part of a monolithic React app and wait 20 minutes for typescript and Docker and javac to do their things and if you are lucky it boots up otherwise you have to start over. I wrote up a criticism of Themis and designed &quot;Nemesis&quot; that was designed for rapid development of new tasks and it was a path not taken at the old job, but Nemesis and I have been chewing through millions of instances of tasks ever since. reply GMoromisato 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Fascinating! I also recoiled at the complexity of React, Docker, etc. and went a different path: I basically moved all the code to the server and added a way to &quot;project&quot; the UI to the browser. From the program&#x27;s perspective, you think you&#x27;re just showing GUI controls on a local screen. There is no client&#x2F;server split. Under the covers, the platform talks to some JavaScript on the browser to render the controls. This works well for me since I grew up programming on Windows PCs, where you have full control over the machine. Check it out if you&#x27;re interested: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gridwhale.com . I think pushing code to the server via HTMX and treating the browser like a dumb terminal has the same kind of advantage: you only have to worry about one system. Fundamentally, IMHO, the client&#x2F;server split is where all the complexity happens. If you&#x27;re writing two programs, on the client and one on the server, you&#x27;re basically creating a distributed system, which we know is very hard. reply pantalaimon 11 minutes ago | prev | next [–] This is why I like embedded.

The first one is especially clear. However, this is just not something that I typically perceive as a problem. For example in the book that I mentioned above, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to use it at all. I just added the fields or the functions that were required. In the first link you provided, the OCaml code seems to use unions as well (I don&#x27;t know the language). I assume OCaml checks for exhaustive matching, so it seems extremely straight forward to extend this code. On the other hand I have absolutely no issues with a big switch case in a more simple language. I just had a look at the code I wrote quite a while ago and it looks fine. reply recursivedoubts 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I love crafting interpreters and mention it on grugbrain: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grugbrain.dev&#x2F;#grug-on-parsing but the visitor pattern is nearly always a bad idea IMO: you should just encode the operation in the tree if you control it or create a recursive function that manually dispatches on the argument type if you don&#x27;t reply 12_throw_away 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] As far as I understand it, the limited circumstances when you absolutely need the visitor pattern are when you have type erasure , i.e., can&#x27;t use a tagged union or its equivalent? In that case visitors are AIUI a very clever trick to use vtables or whatever to get back to your concrete types! but ... clever tricks make grug angry. reply zem 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] even when you have tagged unions, visitors are a useful way to abstract a heterogenous tree traversal from code that processes specific nodes in the tree. e.g. if you have an ast with an `if` node and subnodes `condition`, `if_body`, and `else_body` you could either have the `if node == &quot;if&quot; then call f(subnode) for subnode in [node.condition, node.if_body, node.else_body]` and repeat that for every function `f` that walks the tree, or define a visitor that takes `f` as an argument and keep the knowledge of which subnodes every node has in a single place. reply mrkeen 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You&#x27;re right.

And how does it make the visitor pattern not needed? reply PaulHoule 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tagged_union In languages influenced by ML (like contemporary Java!) it is common in compiler work in that you might have an AST or similar kind of structure and you end up writing a lot of functions that use pattern matching like switch(node) { type1(a,b) -&gt; whatever(a,b) type2(c) -&gt; process(c) } to implement various &quot;functions&quot; such as rewriting the AST into bytecode, building a symbol table, or something. In some cases you could turn this inside out and put a bunch of methods on a bunch of classes that do various things for each kind of node but if you use pattern matching you can neatly group together all the code that does the same thing to all the different objects rather than forcing that code to be spread out on a bunch of different objects. reply tayo42 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] OK yeah I see, that&#x27;s natural to do with like rust enums Java doesn&#x27;t support this though I thought? reply PaulHoule 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Currently Java supports records (finalized in JDK 16) and sealed classes (JDK 17) which together work as algebraic data types; pattern matching in switch was finalized in JDK 21.

Very clubbable. I think I have never created one called &quot;Visitor&quot; in my life. Given the syntax tree example from Wikipedia, I think I&#x27;d call it AstWalker, AstItem::dispatch(AstWalker) and AstWalker::process(AstItem) instead of Visitor, AstItem::accept(AstVisitor) and AstVisitor::visit(AstItem). &quot;The walker walks the AST, each items sends it to the next ones, and the walker processes them&quot;. That means something. &quot;The visitor visits the AST items, which accept it&quot; means basically nothing. It&#x27;s more general, but also contains very little useful information. So the visitor might need different names in different situations. Fine. Just add a comment &quot;visitor pattern&quot; for recognizability. I remember a situation where I needed to walk two object trees for a data comparison and import operation. I created an AbstractImporter that walked the two trees in lockstep in a guaranteed order and invoked virtual methods for each difference. It had a non-virtual doImport() for the ordered data walk, and doImport() called virtual methods like importUserAccount(), importUserAccountGrouMemberships() etc. There were two subclasses of AbstractImporter: ImportAnalyzer collected differences to display them, then there was a selection step implemented by a kind of list model + a bit of controller logic, then an ImportWorker to make the selected changes. All rather specific terminology and not exactly the visitor pattern. reply tempaway43563 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I went to look for that bit.

Notably C succeeded where PL&#x2F;I failed but by 1990 or so you started to see actual specs written by adults such as Common Lisp and Java where you really can start at the beginning and work to the end and not have to skip forward or read the spec twice. That discontinuity is structural though to C and also C++ and you find it in most books about C++ and in little weird anomalies like the way typedefs force the parser to have access to the symbol table. Sure C was a huge advance in portability but C and C++ represent a transitional form between an age where you could cleanly spec a special purpose language like COBOL or FORTRAN but not quite spec a general systems programming language and one in which you could.

What’s wrong with them? reply PaulHoule 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Personally I think Rust is better thought out than C++ but that I&#x27;ve got better things to do than fight with the borrow checker and I appreciate that the garbage collector in Java can handle complexity so I don&#x27;t have to. I think it&#x27;s still little appreciated how revolutionary garbage collection is. You don&#x27;t have maven or cargo for C because you can&#x27;t really smack together arbitrary C libraries together unless the libraries have an impoverished API when it comes to memory management. In general if you care about performance you would want to pass a library a buffer from the application in some cases, or you might want to pass the library custom malloc and free functions. If your API is not impoverished the library can never really know if the application is done with the buffer and the application can&#x27;t know if the library is done. But the garbage collector knows! It is painful to see Rustifarians pushing bubbles around under the rug when the real message the borrow checker is trying to tell them is that their application has a garbage-collector shaped hole in it. &quot;RC all the things&quot; is an answer to reuse but if you are going to do that why not just &quot;GC all the things?&quot; There&#x27;s nothing more painful than watching people struggle with async Rust because async is all about going off the stack and onto the heap and once you do that you go from a borrowing model that is simple and correct to one that is fraught and structurally unstable -- but people are so proud of their ability to fight complexity they can&#x27;t see it. reply rcxdude 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Usually the main message is that they haven&#x27;t thought about the organisation of their datastructures sufficiently. In my experience this is also very important with a GC, but you don&#x27;t get much help from the compiler, instead you wind up chasing strange issues at runtime because object lifetimes don&#x27;t match what you expected (not to mention, object lifetime is more than just memory allocation, and GC languages tend to have less effective means of managing lifetimes tightly). I agree async Rust is very painful still. It&#x27;s very much something I don&#x27;t use unless I have to, and when I do I keep things very simple. (Also, the lack of a package manager for C is much more due to historical cruft around build systems than it is difficulty getting C libraries to work together. Most of them can interoperate perfectly well, though there is a lot more faff with memory book-keeping) reply shadowgovt 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] In our case, a garbage collector is a non-starter because it can&#x27;t make enough guarantees about either constraining space or time to make the suits happy (embedded architecture with some pretty strict constraints on memory and time to execute for safety). I do think that there are a lot of circumstances a garbage collector is the right answer where people, for whatever reason, decide they want to manage memory themselves instead. reply spauldo 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] They&#x27;re probably busy writing code for a living. reply frollogaston 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] They can, but why pay 20 people to learn Rust? reply shadowgovt 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev [–] Flip the question around: what is the benefit when they already know C++? Most of the safety promises one could make with Rust they can already give through proper application of sanitizers and tooling. At least they believe they can, and management believes them. Grug not ask too many questions when the working prototype is already sitting on Grug&#x27;s desk because someone hacked it together last night instead of spending that time learning a new language. I suspect that in a generation or so Rust will probably be where C++ is now: the language business uses because they can quickly find 20 developers who have a career in it. reply Consider applying for YC's Fall 2025 batch!

Hard say at first, especially if you nice grug and don't like disappoint people (many such grugs!) but easier over time even though shiney rock pile not as high as might otherwise be is ok: how many shiney rock grug really need anyway? Saying ok sometimes compromise necessary or no shiney rock, mean no dinosaur meat, not good, wife firmly remind grug about young grugs at home need roof, food, and so forth, no interest in complexity demon spirit rant by grug for fiftieth time in this situation, grug recommend &quot;ok&quot; &quot;ok, grug build that feature&quot; then grug spend time think of 80/20 solution to problem and build that instead. 80/20 solution say &quot;80 want with 20 code&quot; solution maybe not have all bell-whistle that project manager want, maybe a little ugly, but work and deliver most value, and keep demon complexity spirit at bay for most part to extent sometimes probably best just not tell project manager and do it 80/20 way. easier forgive than permission, project managers mind like butterfly at times overworked and dealing with many grugs. often forget what even feature supposed to do or move on or quit or get fired grug see many such cases anyway is in project managers best interest anyway so grug not to feel too bad for this approach usually Factoring Your Code next strategy very harder: break code base up properly (fancy word: &quot;factor your code properly&quot;) here is hard give general advice because each system so different. however, one thing grug come to believe: not factor your application too early! early on in project everything very abstract and like water: very little solid holds for grug's struggling brain to hang on to. take time to develop &quot;shape&quot; of system and learn what even doing. grug try not to factor in early part of project and then, at some point, good cut-points emerge from code base good cut point has narrow interface with rest of system: small number of functions or abstractions that hide complexity demon internally, like trapped in crystal grug quite satisfied when complexity demon trapped properly in crystal, is best feeling to trap mortal enemy! grug try watch patiently as cut points emerge from code and slowly refactor, with code base taking shape over time along with experience. no hard/ fast rule for this: grug know cut point when grug see cut point, just take time to build skill in seeing, patience sometimes grug go too early and get abstractions wrong, so grug bias towards waiting big brain developers often not like this at all and invent many abstractions start of project grug tempted to reach for club and yell &quot;big brain no maintain code! big brain move on next architecture committee leave code for grug deal with!&quot; but grug learn control passions, major difference between grug and animal instead grug try to limit damage of big brain developer early in project by giving them thing like UML diagram (not hurt code, probably throw away anyway) or by demanding working demo tomorrow working demo especially good trick: force big brain make something to actually work to talk about and code to look at that do thing, will help big brain see reality on ground more quickly remember! big brain have big brain! need only be harness for good and not in service of spirit complexity demon on accident, many times seen (best grug brain able to herd multiple big brain in right direction and produce many complexity demon trap crystals, large shiney rock pile awaits such grug!) also sometimes call demo approach &quot;prototype&quot;, sound fancier to project manager grug say prototype early in software making, especially if many big brains Testing grug have love/hate relationship with test: test save grug many, many uncountable time and grug love and respect test unfortunately also many test shamans exist. some test shaman make test idol, demand things like &quot;first test&quot; before grug even write code or have any idea what grug doing domain! how grug test what grug not even understand domain yet!? &quot;Oh, don't worry: the tests will show you what you need to do.&quot; grug once again catch grug slowly reaching for club, but grug stay calm grug instead prefer write most tests after prototype phase, when code has begun firm up but, note well: grug must here be very disciplined! easy grug to move on and not write tests because &quot;work on grugs machine&quot;! this very, very bad: no guarantee work on other machine and no guarantee work on grug machine in future, many times test shaman have good point on importance of test, even if test shaman often sometimes not complete useful feature in life and talk only about test all time, deserve of club but heart in right place also, test shaman often talk unit test very much, but grug not find so useful. grug experience that ideal tests are not unit test or either end-to-end test, but in-between test unit tests fine, ok, but break as implementation change (much compared api!) and make refactor hard and, frankly, many bugs anyway often due interactions other code. often throw away when code change. grug write unit test mostly at start of project, help get things going but not get too attached or expect value long time end to end tests good, show whole system work, but! hard to understand when break and drive grug crazy very often, sometimes grugs just end up ignoring because &quot;oh, that break all time&quot; very bad! in-between tests, grug hear shaman call &quot;integration tests&quot; sometime often with sour look on face. but grug say integration test sweet spot according to grug: high level enough test correctness of system, low level enough, with good debugger, easy to see what break grug prefer some unit tests especially at start but not 100% all code test and definitely not &quot;first test&quot;. &quot;test along the way&quot; work pretty well for grug, especially as grug figure things out grug focus much ferocious integration test effort as cut point emerge and system stabilize! cut point api hopefully stable compared implementation and integration test remain valuable many long time, and easy debug also small, well curated end-to-end test suite is created to be kept working religiously on pain of clubbing. focus of important end-to-end test on most common UI features and few most important edge cases, but not too many or become impossible maintain and then ignored this ideal set of test to grug you may not like, but this peak grug testing also, grug dislike mocking in test, prefer only when absolute necessary to (rare/never) and coarse grain mocking (cut points/systems) only at that one exception &quot;first test&quot; dislike by grug: when bug found. grug always try first reproduce bug with regression test then fix bug, this case only for some reason work better Agile grug think agile not terrible, not good end of day, not worst way to organize development, maybe better than others grug supposes is fine danger, however, is agile shaman! many, many shiney rock lost to agile shaman! whenever agile project fail, agile shaman say &quot;you didn't do agile right!&quot; grug note this awfully convenient for agile shaman, ask more shiney rock better agile train young grugs on agile, danger! grug tempted reach for club when too much agile talk happen but always stay calm prototyping, tools and hiring good grugs better key to success software: agile process ok and help some but sometimes hurt taken too seriously grug say no silver club fix all software problems no matter what agile shaman say (danger!) Refactoring refactoring fine activity and often good idea, especially later in project when code firmed up however, grug note that many times in career &quot;refactors&quot; go horribly off rails and end up causing more harm than good grug not sure exactly why some refactors work well, some fail, but grug notice that larger refactor, more likely failure appear to be so grug try to keep refactors relatively small and not be &quot;too far out from shore&quot; during refactor. ideally system work entire time and each step of finish before other begin. end-to-end tests are life saver here, but often very hard understand why broke... such is refactor life. also grug notice that introducing too much abstraction often lead to refactor failure and system failure. good example was J2EE introduce, many big brain sit around thinking too much abstraction, nothing good came of it many project hurt another good example when company grug work for introduce OSGi to help manage/trap spriit complexity demon in code base. not only OSGi not help, but make complexity demon much more powerful! took multiple man year of best developers to rework as well to boot! more complex spirit and now features impossible implement! very bad! Chesterton's Fence wise grug shaman chesterton once say here exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.” many older grug learn this lesson well not start tearing code out willy nilly, no matter how ugly look grug understand all programmer platonists at some level wish music of spheres perfection in code. but danger is here, world is ugly and gronky many times and so also must code be humility not often come big brained or think big brained easily or grug even, but grug often find &quot;oh, grug no like look of this, grug fix&quot; lead many hours pain grug and no better or system worse even grug early on in career often charge into code base waving club wildly and smash up everything, learn not good grug not say no improve system ever, quite foolish, but recommend take time understand system first especially bigger system is and is respect code working today even if not perfect here tests often good hint for why fence not to be smashed! Microservices grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too seem very confusing to grug Tools grug love tool. tool and control passion what separate grug from dinosaurs! tool allow grug brain to create code that not possible otherwise by doing thinking for grug, always good relief! grug always spend time in new place learning tools around him to maximize productivity: learn tools for two weeks make development often twice faster and often have dig around ask other developers help, no docs code completion in IDE allow grug not have remembered all API, very important! java programming nearly impossible without it for grug! really make grug think some time good debugger worth weight in shiney rocks, in fact also more: when faced with bug grug would often trade all shiney rock and perhaps few children for good debugger and anyway debugger no weigh anything far as grug can tell grug always recommend new programmer learn available debugger very deeply, features like conditional break points, expression evaluation, stack navigation, etc teach new grug more about computer than university class often! grug say never be not improving tooling Type Systems grug very like type systems make programming easier. for grug, type systems most value when grug hit dot on keyboard and list of things grug can do pop up magic. this 90% of value of type system or more to grug big brain type system shaman often say type correctness main point type system, but grug note some big brain type system shaman not often ship code. grug suppose code never shipped is correct, in some sense, but not really what grug mean when say correct grug say tool magic pop up of what can do and complete of code major most benefit of type system, correctness also good but not so nearly so much also, often sometimes caution beware big brains here! some type big brain think in type systems and talk in lemmas, potential danger! danger abstraction too high, big brain type system code become astral projection of platonic generic turing model of computation into code base. grug confused and agree some level very elegant but also very hard do anything like record number of club inventory for Grug Inc. task at hand generics especially dangerous here, grug try limit generics to container classes for most part where most value add temptation generics very large is trick! spirit demon complex love this one trick! beware! always most value type system come: hit dot see what grug can do, never forget! Expression Complexity grug once like to minimize lines of code much as possible. write code like this: if(contact &amp;&amp; !contact.isActive() &amp;&amp; (contact.inGroup(FAMILY) || contact.inGroup(FRIENDS))) { // ... } over time grug learn this hard debug, learn prefer write like so: if(contact) { var contactIsInactive = !contact.isActive(); var contactIsFamilyOrFriends = contact.inGroup(FAMILY) || contact.inGroup(FRIENDS); if(contactIsInactive &amp;&amp; contactIsFamilyOrFriends) { // ... } } grug hear screams from young grugs at horror of many line of code and pointless variable and grug prepare defend self with club club fight start with other developers attack and grug yell: &quot;easier debug! see result of each expression more clearly and good name! easier understand conditional expression! EASIER DEBUG!&quot; definitely easier debug and once club fight end calm down and young grug think a bit, they realize grug right grug still catch grug writing code like first example and often regret, so grug not judge young grug DRY DRY mean Don't Repeat Self, powerful maxim over mind of most developers grug respect DRY and good advice, however grug recommend balance in all things, as gruggest big brain aristotle recommend grug note humourous graph by Lea Verou correspond with grug passion not repeat: over time past ten years program grug not as concerned repeat code. so long as repeat code simple enough and obvious enough, and grug begin feel repeat/copy paste code with small variation is better than many callback/closures passed arguments or elaborate object model: too hard complex for too little benefit at times hard balance here, repeat code always still make grug stare and say &quot;mmm&quot; often, but experience show repeat code sometimes often better than complex DRY solution note well! grug encourage over literal developer not take does work line too serious, is joke Separation of Concerns (SoC) Separation of Concern (SoC) another powerful idea over many developer mind, idea to separate different aspects of system into distinct sections code canonical example from web development: separation of style (css file), markup (html file) and logic (javascript file) here grug much more sour faced than DRY and in fact write big brained essay on alternative design principle locality of behavior (LoB) against SoC grug much prefer put code on the thing that do the thing. now when grug look at the thing grug know the thing what the thing do, alwasy good relief! when separate of concern grug must often all over tarnation many file look understand what how button do, much confuse and time waste: bad! Closures grug like closures for right job and that job usually abstracting operation over collection of objects grug warn closures like salt, type systems and generics: small amount go long way, but easy spoil things too much use give heart attack javascript developers call very special complexity demon spirit in javascript &quot;callback hell&quot; because too much closure used by javascript libraries very sad but also javascript developer get what deserved let grug be frank Logging grug huge fan of logging and encourage lots of it, especially in cloud deployed. some non-grugs say logging expensive and not important. grug used think this way no more funny story: grug learn idol rob pike working on logging at google and decide: &quot;if rob pike working on logging, what grug do there?!?&quot; so not pursue. turn out logging very important to google so of course best programmer work on it, grug! don't be such grug brain, grug, much less shiney rock now! oh well, grug end up at good company anyway and rob pike dress habit increasingly erratic , so all work out in end, but point stand: logging very important! grug tips on logging are: log all major logical branches within code (if/for) if &quot;request&quot; span multiple machine in cloud infrastructure, include request ID in all so logs can be grouped if possible make log level dynamically controlled, so grug can turn on/off when need debug issue (many!) if possible make log level per user, so can debug specific user issue last two points are especially handy club when fighting bugs in production systems very often unfortunately log libraries often very complex (java, why you do? ) but worth investing time in getting logging infrastructure &quot;just right&quot; pay off big later in grug experience logging need taught more in schools, grug think Concurrency grug, like all sane developer, fear concurrency as much as possible, grug try to rely on simple concurrency models like stateless web request handlers and simple remote job worker queues where jobs no interdepend and simple api optimistic concurrency seem work well for web stuff occasionally grug reach for thread local variable , usually when writing framework code some language have good concurrent data structure, like java ConcurrentHashMap but still need careful grug work to get right grug has never used erlang , hear good things, but language look wierd to grug sorry Optimizing ultra biggest of brain developer once say: premature optimization is the root of all evil this everyone mostly know and grug in humble violent agreement with ultra biggest of big brain grug recommend always to have concrete, real world perf profile showing specific perf issue before begin optimizing. never know what actual issue might be, grug often surprise! very often! beware only cpu focus: easy to see cpu and much big o notation thinking having been done in school, but often not root of all slowness, surprise to many including grug hitting network equivalent of many, many millions cpu cycle and always to be minimized if possible, note well big brain microservice developer! inexperienced big brain developer see nested loop and often say &quot;O(n^2)? Not on my watch!&quot; complexity demon spirit smile APIs grug love good apis. good apis not make grug think too much unfortunately, many apis very bad, make grug think quite a bit. this happen many reasons, here two: API creators think in terms of implementation or domain of API, rather than in terms of use of API API creators think too abstract and big brained usually grug not care too deeply about detail of api: want write file or sort list or whatever, just want to call write() or sort() or whatever but big brain api developers say: &quot;not so fast, grug! is that file open for write ? did you define a Comparator for that sort?&quot; grug find self restraining hand reaching for club again not care about that stuff right now, just want sort and write file mr big brain! grug recognize that big brain api designer have point and that sometime these things matter, but often do not. big brain api developers better if design for simple cases with simple api, make complex cases possible with more complex api grug call this &quot;layering&quot; apis: two or three different apis at different level complexity for various grug needs also, if object oriented, put api on thing instead of elsewhere. java worst at this! grug want filter list in java &quot;Did you convert it to a stream?&quot; fine, grug convert to stream &quot;OK, now you can filter.&quot; OK, but now need return list! have stream! &quot;Well, did you collect your stream into a list?&quot; what? &quot;Define a Collector&lt;? super T, A, R&gt; to collect your stream into a list&quot; grug now swear on ancestor grave he club every single person in room, but count two instead and remain calm put common thing like filter() on list and make return list, listen well big brain java api developer! nobody care about &quot;stream&quot; or even hear of &quot;stream&quot; before, is not networking api, all java grugs use list mr big brain! Parsing grug love make programming language at drop of hat and say recursive descent most fun and beautiful way create parser unfortunately many big brain school teach only parser generator tool. here grug usual love of tool is not: parser generator tool generate code of awful snakes nest: impossible understand, bottom up, what? hide recursive nature of grammar from grug and debug impossible, very bad according grug! grug think this because while complexity demon bad for code base and understand, complexity demon very good for generation of much academic papers, sad but true production parser almost always recursive descent, despite ignore by schools! grug furious when learn how simple parse is! parsing not big brain only magic: so can you! grug very elated find big brain developer Bob Nystrom redeem the big brain tribe and write excellent book on recursive descent: Crafting Interpreters book available online free, but grug highly recommend all interested grugs purchase book on general principle, provide much big brain advice and grug love book very much except visitor pattern (trap!) The Visitor Pattern bad Front End Development some non-grugs, when faced with web development say: &quot;I know, I'll split my front end and back end codebase up and use a hot new SPA library talking to a GraphQL JSON API back end over HTTP (which is funny because I'm not transferring hypertext)&quot; now you have two complexity demon spirit lairs and, what is worse, front end complexity demon spirit even more powerful and have deep spiritual hold on entire front end industry as far as grug can tell back end developers try keep things simple and can work ok, but front end developers make very complex very quickly and introduce lots of code, demon complex spirit even when website just need put form into database or simple brochure site! everyone do this now! grug not sure why except maybe facebook and google say so, but that not seem very good reason to grug grug not like big complex front end libraries everyone use grug make htmx and hyperscript to avoid keep complexity low, simple HTML, avoid lots javascript, the natural ether of spirit complexity demon maybe they work for you, but no job post, sorry react better for job and also some type application, but also you become alcolyte of complexity demon whether you like or no, sorry such is front end life Fads grug note lots of fads in development, especially front end development today back end better more boring because all bad ideas have tried at this point maybe (still retry some!) still trying all bad ideas in front end development so still much change and hard to know grug recommend taking all revolutionary new approach with grain salt: big brains have working for long time on computers now, most ideas have tried at least once grug not saying can't learn new tricks or no good new ideas, but also much of time wasted on recycled bad ideas, lots of spirit complexity demon power come from putting new idea willy nilly into code base Fear Of Looking Dumb note! very good if senior grug willing to say publicly: &quot;hmmm, this too complex for grug&quot;! many developers Fear Of Looking Dumb (FOLD), grug also at one time FOLD, but grug learn get over: very important senior grug say &quot;this too complicated and confuse to me&quot; this make it ok for junior grugs to admit too complex and not understand as well, often such case! FOLD major source of complexity demon power over developer, especially young grugs! take FOLD power away, very good of senior grug! note: important to make thinking face and look big brained when saying though. be prepare for big brain or, worse and much more common, thinks is big brain to make snide remark of grug be strong! no FOLD! club sometimes useful here, but more often sense of humor and especially last failed project by big brain very useful, so collect and be calm Impostor Syndrome grug note many such impostor feels in development always grug one of two states: grug is ruler of all survey, wield code club like thor OR grug have no idea what doing grug is mostly latter state most times, hide it pretty well though now, grug make softwares of much work and moderate open source success , and yet grug himself often feel not any idea what doing! very often! grug still fear make mistake break everyone code and disappoint other grugs, imposter! is maybe nature of programming for most grug to feel impostor and be ok with is best: nobody imposter if everybody imposter any young grug read this far probably do fine in program career even if frustrations and worry is always to be there, sorry Reads grug like these: Worse is Better Worse is Better is Worse Is Worse Really Better?

Changing climate (desertification) and economic conditions have meant that a lot of people have given up their nomadic lifestyle and moved to cities or their outskirts (mostly Ulaanbaatar). They often are reluctant to do so, it&#x27;s a big step, and they often hope it is a temporary one. They set up their yurts not only because of housing shortages, but many are also hesitant to move into apartments or other permanent structures as it&#x27;s seen as the last step in giving up this nomadic lifestyle. Often they are setting up their yurts next to permanent structures, either because they are living in the &#x27;yard&#x27; of relatives or to expand their residences and stay connected to their culture.

There are many ways to try to understand a society, whether it be quantifying it or looking at the lived experiences within it. If you look at data provided by the World Bank, you&rsquo;ll see a country that has rapidly reduced poverty in the 21st century, has a high economic growth rate, a healthy fertility rate, and is solidly an upper-middle-income country. While Mongolia is a republic with a competitive party system, Worldwide Governance Indicators from the World Bank show a government that has issues with corruption, regulatory quality, and effectiveness. Indicator Value Years Population 3,481,145 2023 Fertility rate 2.7 2023 Intentional homicides (per 100,000 people) 6 2021 Individuals using the Internet (% of population) 1% → 83% 2000 → 2023 Poverty headcount ratio at $2.15 a day (2017 PPP) (% of population) 11.6% → 0.2% 2002 → 2022 Average GDP growth 6.62% 2003 → 2023 GDP per capita, PPP (current international $) $4,399.4 → $18,004.9 2003 → 2023 (“Mongolia”) All of these indicators are interesting to look at, but they don&rsquo;t really show what a society is like. I feel you get much more understanding by going to a country, walking the streets, and talking to people there. If you&rsquo;re unable to do this, the next best thing is spending hours exploring Google Maps, which I did. I opened a satellite view of Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. I saw new glass buildings, Soviet-designed apartment blocks (called ugsarmal), impressive government buildings, factories, and industrial areas. But something stood out to me. Yurts, extending for kilometers in all directions. Maps Data: Google © 2025 Airbus, CNES / Airbus, Maxar Technologies Naturally, I was impressed by the quantity of yurts I saw, and I was curious: just how many yurts (ger in Mongolian) are in Mongolia and why? This set me on the path drawing bounding boxes on over 10,000 yurts to train a machine learning model to count the rest of the yurts in the country. While I was training the model, I wondered what the story behind these yurts are, I did a small investigation for later in this article. For now, this is the story of counting them. Counting all the yurts in Mongolia I was unable to find a count of the yurts in Mongolia, this left me with the task of doing it myself. Although I had never studied or worked with machine learning, I knew through some osmosis that machine learning is well fit for this task. I created a simple plan in my brain: Train a model to identify yurts Reduce input space and parallelize searching of input space Keep track of the yurts found Training a model to identify yurts The first thing I needed was training data, and lots of it. There&rsquo;s many different options for satellite imagery such as Mapbox , Google Maps , and ArcGIS . I decided to use Google Maps since I&rsquo;m already familiar with it. For digital maps, many systems break the world up into a series of 256 x 256 tiles identified by X, Y, Z values. This is referred to as tiled web maps and allows for progressively loading maps at different zoom levels and positions. The zoom level values tend to be 0 through 20, where 0 has the least tiles and 20 the most. The formula for calculating the number of tiles at a given zoom (z) level is: $2^z * 2^z$ . This means increasing z by one will increase the tile count by four times. I wrote a Python script that generated tiles from a box around Ulaanbaatar and downloaded them to a folder to use as training data. To list the tiles inside a bounding box made up of a southwest and northeast coordinates, I used the mercantile package . for tile in mercantile . tiles ( sw_lng , sw_lat , ne_lng , ne_lat , zooms = z ): download_tile ( * tile ) Tiles from Google Maps, you can see yurts on the right tile. Maps Data: Google © 2025 Airbus, CNES / Airbus, Maxar Technologies I decided to start at zoom level 17 as it is the lowest zoom level that I can still identify yurts at. Once I downloaded several hundred tiles at this zoom level, I needed a way to label the yurts on these tiles. Labeling is the process of drawing boxes around objects in an image. The idea is to draw these boxes manually, creating what is called annotated data, and then training a model to do the labeling using the annotated data. There&rsquo;s an open source tool called Label Studio that does just this. Here I drew bounding boxes on the tile around the yurts. A couple dozen yurts later and I wanted to try and train a model based on my tiny amount of annotated data. I had the choice between object detection (bounding boxes) and segmentation (outline objects). Segmentation probably would be more accurate because yurts are not rectangular, but it seemed like it would take longer to setup. I decided to go with object detection. I looked at various ways to train an object detection model, my requirements were: Open source As simple as possible to setup Able to quickly iterate Detection speed of the model is a priority due to the potentially large amount of data Has good default settings around data augmentation, warmups, loss functions, etc Monitor current and previous training runs to compare accuracy After doing a brief survey of the machine learning landscape, I landed on using YOLO11 by Ultralytics. The YOLO series is a set of models that can complete computer vision tasks, and can be trained with custom data. In Label Studio you&rsquo;re able to export to many different dataset types, YOLO being one of them. After exporting my annotated data as a YOLO dataset, I split the dataset into training and validation data and configured the dataset in dataset.yaml for YOLO to use. dataset.yaml train : images/train val : images/val nc : 1 names : - yurt From the ultralytics package, I used the YOLO class to use their pre-trained yolo11n object detection model. Ultralytics allows easy tuning of the model with annotated data through the train method of the YOLO class. The tuned model can be exported through export in various formats. from ultralytics import YOLO model = YOLO ( &#34;yolo11n.pt&#34; ) model . train ( data = &#34;dataset.yaml&#34; , device = &#34;cpu&#34; , ) path = model . export ( name = &#34;yurt&#34; ) With some testing I found my Yurt model was less than adequate, which I expected due to the tiny amount of annotated data. I then did a couple hours of labeling, but the model would always miss around 10-15% of the yurts in a given tile. At this point I had two options, either increase the zoom level or gather more training data. To base my decision I decided to calculate how many tiles I would need to search at each zoom level. Refining the search area Mongolia is 1,564,116 square kilometers, using this we can calculate how many tiles at each zoom level there are in Mongolia. The world has $2^z * 2^z$ tiles, so on a single axis there are $2^z$ tiles. The map projection is from a sphere a tile will represent more or less area depending on the latitude. To find the width of the projection at a latitude for Web Mercator, we can use this formula where $R = 6,378.137$ is the radius of the equator in kilometers and $\phi = 47.923107575288114$ is the latitude of Mongolia in degrees which is converted to radians: $$2\pi * R * \cos(\phi * \dfrac{\pi}{180}) = 40,070.746611413$$ We then need to divide the number of tiles on the x-axis at this location to get the width of a tile. For the area of a tile, just square the width and divide the area of Mongolia by the area of a single tile to get the tile count. Zoom Level Tile Count 17 37,258,617 18 149,034,469 19 596,137,879 20 2,384,551,518 Since Mongolia is such a large country, I began to wonder if there are more ways to reduce the amount of tiles other than just zoom level. It&rsquo;s a sparsely populated country, with much of the country being uninhabited. Also, nearly all yurts are located in urban areas, with the City of Ulaanbaatar estimating 60% of the population lives in ger (yurt) districts (City of Ulaanbaatar 17). I used overpass turbo to do a query for all the places human settlements might be in the country and exported this data as GeoJSON. The query returned several thousand points of interest. [out:json][timeout:25]; {{geocodeArea:Mongolia}}-&gt;.searchArea; ( node[place](area.searchArea); node[man_made](area.searchArea); node[historic](area.searchArea); ); out body; &gt;; out skel qt; I wanted to know how many unique tiles for searching a 2,000 meter area around each point there are, so I wrote a script to do this using geopandas. gdf = gpd . read_file ( &#34;./mongolia.geojson&#34; ) gdf_merc = gdf . to_crs ( &#34;EPSG:3857&#34; ) gdf_merc [ &#34;buffer&#34; ] = gdf_merc . geometry . buffer ( 2000 ) gdf_buffer = gdf_merc . set_geometry ( &#34;buffer&#34; ) . to_crs ( &#34;EPSG:4326&#34; ) tiles = {} for polygon in gdf_buffer . geometry : minx , miny , maxx , maxy = polygon . bounds for tile in mercantile . tiles ( minx , miny , maxx , maxy , zooms = Z ): tiles [ &#34; {} - {} - {} &#34; . format ( str ( tile . x ), str ( tile . y ), str ( tile . z ))] = True Zoom Level Tile Count 17 270,559 18 1,016,617 19 3,938,174 20 15,506,872 Building a model backend for labeling To speed up the labeling of yurts I wanted Label Studio to use my model to label yurts. Label Studio has the ability to integrate with a model backend, essentially an API wrapper around a model, to request predictions. When labeling a tile, Label Studio makes a request to this API for predictions. The API returns the bounding boxes for the tile. I fix any mistakes the model made, and submit the tile. Every so often I retrain the model, creating a feedback loop that improves the model with more and more annotated data. backend.py class YurtModel : # Initialize trained model to reuse across requests def __init__ ( self ): self . model = YOLO ( &#34;best.pt&#34; , task = &#34;detect&#34; ) # Task a task sent by Label Studio, and return bounding boxes of yurts def predict ( self , tasks ): predictions = [] for task in tasks : # Get the path to the file from label studio path = get_local_path ( task [ &#34;data&#34; ][ &#34;image&#34; ], task_id = task [ &#34;id&#34; ], ) results = self . model ( path ) for result in results : regions = [] for prediction in result . boxes : xyxy = prediction . xyxy [ 0 ] . tolist () regions . append ({ &#34;model_version&#34; : &#34;1.0&#34; , &#34;from_name&#34; : &#34;label&#34; , &#34;to_name&#34; : &#34;image&#34; , &#34;type&#34; : &#34;rectanglelabels&#34; , &#34;score&#34; : prediction . conf . item (), &#34;value&#34; : { &#34;x&#34; : xyxy [ 0 ] / 256 * 100 , &#34;y&#34; : xyxy [ 1 ] / 256 * 100 , &#34;width&#34; : ( xyxy [ 2 ] - xyxy [ 0 ]) / 256 * 100 , &#34;height&#34; : ( xyxy [ 3 ] - xyxy [ 1 ]) / 256 * 100 , &#34;rectanglelabels&#34; : [ &#34;yurt&#34; , ], }, }) all_scores = [ region [ &#34;score&#34; ] for region in regions if &#34;score&#34; in region ] avg_score = sum ( all_scores ) / max ( len ( all_scores ), 1 ) predictions . append ({ &#34;result&#34; : regions , &#34;score&#34; : avg_score , &#34;model_version&#34; : &#34;1.0&#34; , }) return { &#34;results&#34; : predictions , } model = YurtModel () We then need to fill out the API routes that Label Studio expects, which is a /predict route for label studio to send tiles and receive predictions, a /setup route to do any initialization required, and a /health route to do health checks on. I used FastAPI to build the API and use the YurtModel from above. backend.py @app . post ( &#34;/predict&#34; ) async def predict ( request : Request ): res = await request . json () return model . predict ( res [ &#34;tasks&#34; ]) @app . post ( &#34;/setup&#34; ) async def setup (): return { &#34;model_version&#34; : &#34;1.0&#34; , } @app . get ( &#34;/health&#34; ) async def health (): return { &#34;status&#34; : &#34;UP&#34; , &#34;model_class&#34; : str ( YurtModel . __class__ ), } By relying on the model to find most of the yurts when labeling, I was able to rapidly create more annotated data. I quickly built a dataset of over 10,000 yurts. Monitoring accuracy of each model Scaling training of models As the size of the annotated data grew, training the models on my laptop became too slow. I decided to use vast.ai to rent GPUs to do my training runs. To train the models on vast.ai, I needed everything to run in Docker. I wrote a Dockerfile for the training script, and I pushed it to GitHub Container Registry . In vast.ai I set up authentication with the private image registry so it could pull the image I pushed up. Docker authentication in vast.ai Here is the Dockerfile that I used to run the training script on the dataset I created. FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.10-bookworm-slim WORKDIR /app # Copy training script, annotated data, and requirements to image COPY scripts/train_model.py . COPY datasets ./datasets COPY dataset.yaml . COPY pyproject.toml . COPY uv.lock . # Needed for ... RUN apt-get update -y &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y libgl1-mesa-dev libglib2.0-0 # Install package requirements RUN uv sync --no-dev # Run the training script CMD [ &#34;uv&#34; , &#34;run&#34; , &#34;python&#34; , &#34;train_model.py&#34; ] In order to build and push this image to GitHub I ran: docker build -t ghcr.io/monroeclinton/yurt -f Dockerfile . docker push ghcr.io/monroeclinton/yurt:latest Since the training happened in ephemeral containers, I needed a way to retrieve the finished model. I decided to upload the model to S3 after it finished training. To monitor the accuracy of the models, I also needed the metadata associated with the runs, so I uploaded everything in the run folder to S3. train_model.py model = YOLO ( &#34;yolo11n.pt&#34; ) model . train ( data = &#34;dataset.yaml&#34; , epochs = 1000 , patience = 150 , imgsz = 256 , device = &#34;cuda&#34; , ) path = model . export ( name = &#34;yurt&#34; ) train_dir = os . path . dirname ( os . path . dirname ( path )) s3 = boto3 . client ( service_name = &#34;s3&#34; , endpoint_url = os . environ [ &#34;S3_ENDPOINT&#34; ], aws_access_key_id = os . environ [ &#34;S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID&#34; ], aws_secret_access_key = os . environ [ &#34;S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&#34; ], region_name = os . environ [ &#34;S3_REGION&#34; ], ) timestamp = time . time () for root , dirs , files in os . walk ( train_dir ): for file in files : local_path = os . path . join ( root , file ) s3_key = f &#34;models/ { int ( timestamp ) } / { os . path . relpath ( local_path , train_dir ) } &#34; s3 . upload_file ( local_path , os . environ [ &#34;S3_BUCKET&#34; ], s3_key ) Deploying models and searching Mongolia After dozens of training runs and greatly improving the accuracy of the model, I decided to finally do my count of Mongolia. There were many options to run my deployment, however I made my choice based on three criteria: Simplicity in setup and deployment At least 100 instances of my model should be run The bottleneck is I/O (downloading tiles), so should be deployed on many CPUs Based on these criteria, I used Docker Swarm to orchestrate the workload. It&rsquo;s already packaged in Docker, so there&rsquo;s no need to install anything else. Docker Swarm also is fairly simple to set up, scale, and deploy services with. I rented eight servers, each with 16 vCPUs (128 vCPUs total), and connected them over a private network. I picked one server to be the manager node . On this server, I ran this to initialize the swarm: docker swarm init --advertise-addr 10.0.0.2 This command sets up the swarm and prints a command to run on the worker nodes to connect them to the manager. Each worker node joined using the token and the manager’s address: docker swarm join --token SWARM_TOKEN 10.0.0.2:2377 I deployed the container images, which I had pushed to GHCR, and pulled with --with-registry-auth to allow access from the server to GHCR. There were two images, the api image and the worker image. The API managed a list of search areas (the areas around the points found from overpass turbo), giving search areas to workers, and expanding the search radius by 500 meters when yurts were found. The workers requested search areas from the API and sent back a list of yurts found within the search areas. API I used FastAPI to build the API, in which there were two routes. GET /search-area - Workers sent a request to this route to get a search area to search. This route first checks if there are any stale areas, where a worker had requested a search area but never finished it. The workers should send periodic health checks to the API, if this fails then it will return the search area to a different worker after one minute. stale_area = ( db . query ( SearchArea ) . filter ( SearchArea . searching == True ) . filter ( SearchArea . health_check &lt; one_minute_ago ) . with_for_update () . first () ) If there are no stale search areas, then a new point will be selected at random, and the search area will be increased if there have been previous searches. point = ( db . query ( Point ) . options ( joinedload ( Point . search_areas )) . filter ( Point . searched == False ) . filter ( ~ Point . search_areas . any ( SearchArea . searched == False )) . order_by ( func . random ()) . first () ) if not point : raise HTTPException ( status_code = 404 , detail = &#34;No available point to search&#34; ) previous_areas = [ sa for sa in point . search_areas ] if previous_areas : max_meters = max ( area . meters for area in previous_areas ) new_meters = max_meters + 500 else : new_meters = 500 A SearchArea has a list of tiles that are inside it. Each Tile has as status of searched . I used geopandas, as shown earlier, to generate a bounding box over the search area and create a list of tiles. For each of these tiles, I check the database to see if they have already been created + searched. If they haven&rsquo;t then they are upserted and assigned to the search area. created_tiles = ( db . query ( Tile ) . filter ( tuple_ ( Tile . x , Tile . y , Tile . z ) . in_ ( [( tile [ &#34;x&#34; ], tile [ &#34;y&#34; ], tile [ &#34;z&#34; ]) for tile in tiles_to_create ] ) ) . all () ) new_area . tiles . extend ( created_tiles ) The route returns the search area, containing a list of tiles to search. POST /search-area/:id - Workers sent a request containing the yurts to this route. This route inserts the yurts into the database, and marks the Point , SearchArea , and Tile as searched as needed. The Point gets marked as searched if no yurts are found, and the SearchArea and Tile are marked as searched. if len ( yurts_to_create ) &gt; 0 : stmt = insert ( Yurt ) . values ( yurts_to_create ) stmt = stmt . on_conflict_do_nothing ( index_elements = [ &#34;longitude&#34; , &#34;latitude&#34; ]) db . execute ( stmt ) else : db . execute ( update ( Point ) . where ( exists () . where ( ( SearchArea . point_id == Point . id ) &amp; ( Point . id == id ) ) ) . values ( searched = True , ) ) Worker The worker script ran in a loop until it encountered the No available point to search error. This loop consisted of requesting the /search-area to get a list of tiles to search, downloading each tile, then passing the tile image to the model to detect yurts. Finally, the worker sends a list of yurts to the API. def find_yurts ( x , y , z ): filepath = os . path . join ( &#34;tiles&#34; , &#34; {} _ {} _ {} .jpeg&#34; . format ( x , y , z )) results = model ( filepath , imgsz = 256 ) yurts = [] for result in results : for prediction in result . boxes : xyxy = prediction . xyxy [ 0 ] . tolist () # Find center of the bounding box pixel_x = xyxy [ 0 ] + ( xyxy [ 2 ] - xyxy [ 0 ]) / 2 pixel_y = xyxy [ 1 ] + ( xyxy [ 3 ] - xyxy [ 1 ]) / 2 lat , lon = tile_xyz_to_lonlat ( x , y , z , pixel_x , pixel_y ) yurts . append ({ &#34;latitude&#34; : lat , &#34;longitude&#34; : lon , &#34;score&#34; : prediction . conf . item (), }) return yurts I began scaling this service slowly and eventually ramped up to 120 workers running in parallel using docker service scale worker=120 . Each container processed its assigned tile, and if yurts were found, posted their coordinates to the API. The resulting count After searching a couple million tiles I downloaded the yurt dataset, which I uploaded here (12mb file) . In total I found 172,689 yurts with a probability score of greater than 40%. Perhaps there&rsquo;s some lonesome yurts far in the Gobi Desert or the Altai Mountains I missed, so we could add a hundred or so for those. I could have also done more like providing image context and training on more data from smaller towns, but I only have so much time. For fun I did some querying using PostGIS to find areas with high concentrations of yurts. Generally I found places that are hotels or remote areas near mines. Maps Data: Google © 2025 Airbus, CNES / Airbus, Maxar Technologies The people of the yurts Historically, yurts have been a home for the nomadic peoples of the steppe to live. As Mongolia developed into the modern world, the usage of yurts changed with the country. For example, I found a reference to yurts being used as makeshift schools in the early 1900s. This period was the start of the transformation from a nomadic herder society to an urban industrial society. In the rural areas, in addition to the existing 60 scribe schools, at least 49 state primary schools were established by 1917. They were largely housed in yurts and financed with state, municipal, and private funds. (Steiner-Khamsi and Stolpe 36) This reflects the developmental history of Mongolia, and how people are adjusting to the modern world. Mongolia has transitioned from a mostly nomadic herder society, to a mostly urbanized industrial society. As people transition from one system of life to another, remnants of their old system persist. Housing and infrastructure are expensive, so as Mongolia transformed, once nomadic herders took their yurts to urban areas and continued living in them. The 51 percent urban population reported in the 1979 census reflected rapid migration to the cities in the 1970s. The influx of rural people created housing problems, among them long waits for assignment to an apartment, expansion of ger districts on the edges of built-up areas, and pressure to invest in more housing, roads, and other urban infrastructure. (Worden et al. 86) Due to the large number of people moving to urban locations, it has been difficult for the government to build the infrastructure needed for them. The informal settlements that grew from this difficulty are now known as ger districts. There have been many efforts to formalize and develop these areas. The Law on Allocation of Land to Mongolian Citizens for Ownership, passed in 2002, allowed for existing ger district residents to formalize the land they settled, and allowed for others to receive land from the government into the future. Along with the privatization of land, the Mongolian government has been pushing for the development of ger districts into areas with housing blocks connected to utilities. The plan for this was published in 2014 as Ulaanbaatar 2020 Master Plan and Development Approaches for 2030. Although progress has been slow (Choi and Enkhbat 7), they have been making progress in building housing blocks in ger distrcts. Residents of ger districts sell or exchange their plots to developers who then build housing blocks on them. Often this is in exchange for an apartment in the building, and often the value of the apartment is less than the land they originally had (Choi and Enkhbat 15). Based on what I&rsquo;ve read about the ger districts, they have been around since at least the 1970s, and progress on developing them has been slow. When ineffective policy results in a large chunk of the populace generationally living in yurts on the outskirts of urban areas, it&rsquo;s clear that there is failure. One of the most important functions of government is inspiring the citizenry to achieve greatness. Most governments around the world fail in this, but we should all work towards it. I think a step the Mongolian government could take for this is to analyze which policy failures have led to such slow progress on the ger district issue. The Mongolian government&rsquo;s long-term vision is to provide utilities and good housing for these areas. Although I can&rsquo;t contribute anything to this vision, I wish for the best success in this plan. I&rsquo;m glad to have learned about a country and people I used to know nothing about. Hopefully in the future I&rsquo;ll study more about Mongolia, but for now I&rsquo;m off to my next project. Further questions What causes Mongolia and other countries to urbanize and industrialize? Why do some Mongolians head to the cities and others stay? What challenges does the Mongolian government face in developing ger districts? What causes the difference in speed of development between countries?

The test was completed successfully, the first time Honda landed a rocket after reaching an altitude of nearly 300 meters. This test marked the first launch and landing test conducted by Honda with an aim to demonstrate key technologies essential for rocket reusability, such as flight stability during ascent and descent, as well as landing capability. Through this successful test, Honda achieved its intended rocket behaviors for the launch and landing (reaching an altitude of 271.4 m, and landing within 37cm of the target touchdown point, with a flight duration of 56.6 sec), while obtaining data during the ascent and descent. ＜Overview of launch and landing test of a Honda reusable rocket＞ ・Purpose:     Establishment of key technologies necessary for a reusable rocket ・Location:     Honda facility in Taiki Town *2 , Hiroo District, Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan ・Date/Time:  June 17, 2025. Launch time: 16:15 Test being conducted in Taiki Town in Hokkaido, Japan(Photo taken in May, 2025) Launch and landing test *1 A reusable rocket, also known as a reusable launch vehicle (RLV), is a type of rocket that, unlike a conventional expendable launch vehicle (ELV), can be used repeatedly in a short period of time. A reusable rocket is launched in a vertical position, reaches an altitude of around 100 kilometers, and then lands back on earth while maintaining a vertical position. *2 Taiki Town, located in southeastern Hokkaido, Japan, has been developing itself as a “space town” through the joint efforts of public and private sectors, and various aviation/space related tests are being conducted by a wide range of organizations including JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), businesses and universities. ＜Safety measures for Honda rocket testing＞ Since 2024, Honda has been safely conducting engine combustion tests and hovering tests for its reusable rockets in Taiki Town in Hiroo District, Hokkaido, Japan. As with all previous tests, Honda conducted this launch and landing test while placing the highest priority on safety and with the understanding and cooperation of local authorities and residents.  Specific safety measures taken for this test A restricted area with a 1-kilometer radius was established. During the test, access to the area was restricted through the installation of signs and gates, as well as the deployment of security personnel. The restricted area was defined by calculating the potential area where the rocket could fall to earth in the event of a thrust cut-off and by adding a sufficient buffer zone (safe distance calculated based on the guidelines set forth by the Cabinet Office of the Government of Japan) that would cover the potential area where a blast wave, debris dispersion, or fireballs could impact in the event of an explosion within the potential fall area. The experimental rocket was equipped with a safety system to prevent deviation from a pre-defined flight corridor, speed and attitude conditions, ensuring no impact beyond the restricted area. ＜Honda initiatives in the areas of rocket research＞ As announced in 2021, Honda has been pursuing research and development in the field of space technologies while viewing it as a place to take on challenges to realize the “dreams” and “potential” of people worldwide while leveraging its core technologies. Honda has the aim to enable people to transcend the constraints of time, place or ability and make people’s daily lives more enjoyable. Examples of Honda initiatives toward creating new value in the ultimate environment of outer space include research into a circulative renewable energy system, key robotic technologies for use in outer space and reusable rockets.  Inspired by the dream of young Honda engineers who wanted to build rockets by utilizing core technologies amassed by Honda through the development of various products, such as combustion and control technologies, Honda started rocket research based on the belief that it has the potential to contribute more to people’s daily lives by launching satellites with its own rockets, that could lead to various services *3 that are also compatible with other Honda business. In today’s world, vast amounts of data are consumed, with the growing expectation for greater utilization of a data system in outer space through expanded use of satellites. In light of this trend, the need for satellite launch rockets is also expected to increase in the coming years. In this market environment, Honda has chosen to take on the technological challenge of developing reusable rockets by utilizing Honda technologies amassed in the development of various products and automated driving systems, based on a belief that reusable rockets will contribute to achieving sustainable transportation. Although Honda rocket research is still in the fundamental research phase, and no decisions have been made regarding commercialization of these rocket technologies, Honda will continue making progress in the fundamental research with a technology development goal of realizing technological capability to enable a suborbital launch by 2029.  Comments by Toshihiro Mibe, Global CEO of Honda “We are pleased that Honda has made another step forward in our research on reusable rockets with this successful completion of a launch and landing test. We believe that rocket research is a meaningful endeavor that leverages Honda’s technological strengths. Honda will continue to take on new challenges—not only to offer our customers various services and value through our products, while addressing environmental and safety issues, but also to continue creating new value which will make people’s time and place more enjoyable.” *3 Examples include remote sensing to monitor Earth conditions such as global warming and extreme weather, as well as satellite constellations that enable wide-area communication, which is an essential component for connected features of mobility products.

What I most like about this news is that Honda has joined Blue Origin and SpaceX in demonstrating a complete &quot;hop&quot; (all though my all time favorite is the &quot;ring of fire&quot; video SpaceX did.) But it also illustrates that I&#x27;ve seen in the Bay Area time and time again, which is that once you demonstrate that something is doable (as SpaceX has) It opens the way for other capital to create competitive systems. At Google, where I worked for a few years, it was interesting to see how Google&#x27;s understanding of search (publicly disclosed), and the infrastructure to host it (kept secret) kept it comfortably ahead of competitors until the design space was exhausted. At which point Google stopped moving forward and everyone else asymptotically approached their level of understanding and mastery. I see the same thing happening to SpaceX. As other firms master the art of the reusable booster, SpaceX&#x27;s grasp on the launch services market weakens. Just as Google&#x27;s grasp of the search market weakens. Or Sun&#x27;s grasp of the server market weakened. When it becomes possible to buy launch services from another vendor which are comparable (not necessarily cheaper, just comparable) without the baggage of the damage Elon has done, SpaceX will be in a tougher spot. It also helps me to understand just how much SpaceX needs Starship in order to stay on top of the market. Some folks will no doubt see this as casting shade on SpaceX, I assure you it is not. What SpaceX&#x27;s engineering teams have accomplished remains amazing and they deserve their success. It is just someone who has been through a number of technology curves noting how similar the they play out over their lifetimes. Having witnessed first hand how DEC felt that Sun&#x27;s &quot;toy computers&quot; would never eclipse DEC in the Server business, and watched as United Launch Alliance dismissed Falcon 9 as something that would never seriously challenge their capabilities, it feels almost prophetic to watch SpaceX&#x27;s competitors emerge. reply gpm 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; What I most like about this news is that Honda has joined Blue Origin and SpaceX in demonstrating a complete &quot;hop The list is longer than that!

This is the &quot;markets mature and commodify over time&quot; thing. What companies are supposed to do in those cases are one of two things. One, keep investing the money into the market or related ones so you keep having an advantage. Or two, if there is nothing relevant and adjacent to productively invest in, return it to shareholders as dividends or share buybacks so they can invest it in some other unrelated market. But space seems like it would be the first one big time because of the amount of stuff that still has yet to be developed. Starlink was an obvious example of something in that nature, and then it&#x27;s going to be things like &quot;put datacenters in orbit so you can use solar without worrying about clouds or nighttime&quot; and &quot;build robots that can do semi-autonomous work in places far enough away for both human presence and round trip latency to be an inconvenience&quot; etc. We&#x27;d be living in Star Trek by the time they&#x27;d run out of something more to do. reply palata 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; We&#x27;d be living in Star Trek by the time they&#x27;d run out of something more to do.

And I suspect that&#x27;s doubly true for launch customers outside the US. reply panick21_ 25 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think you are to optimistic, what you say is true in principle, but it will take much longer. Vertical landing isn&#x27;t really the technical challenge. Many small vehicles have demonstrated this over the years, including before SpaceX. The challenge with orbital booster reuse is getting them threw the atmosphere intact and ready to land and then be reused quickly. And do that while being optimized enough to carry payload. That is the actual challenge. And that&#x27;s just the first, then you need to build everything to be able to do this 5-10 times. Only one other company then SpaceX has achieved getting a booster back at all, and that was by dropping it into an ocean. RocketLab, and they so far as I know have never reflown a complete booster. BlueOrigin has never landed a complete booster. ULA and Arianespace aren&#x27;t close. Honda in particular is not a launch competitor and is very unlikely to be one in the future. Japan already has a pet rocket that they support that has low launch rates. Honda isn&#x27;t just isn&#x27;t a competitor in the launch sector, and I don&#x27;t think they are even planning that. BlueOrigin might emerge as a competitor, but its nothing like Sun (sun was profitable in the first year). BlueOrigin simply has an infinite money glitch, that almost no other company in history had. The amount of money BlueOrigin spent in the last 10 year is actually unbelievable, they at times had the same amount of people as SpaceX, while having near 0 revenue. By any rational evaluation BlueOrigin is completely non-viable as a company, any they are burning billions per year. RocketLab will likely be a real competitor eventually, but they are pretty clearly positioning themselves at being Nr.2, not aiming for flight rates nearly in SpaceX territory. And they have a lot of technical risk left to clear. At the moment SpaceX is moving forward faster then anybody else is catching up. Falcon 9&#x2F;Falcon Heavy still run loops around everybody and nobody will challenge it for another 10 years at least, and that&#x27;s assuming Falcon 9 operations don&#x27;t improve. Starship isn&#x27;t needed for the launch market, but for their own constellation. reply kortilla 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Is this meaningful without it being orbital? reply iancmceachern 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] We were sending stuff into orbit far before we could reliably, reusabley, land a rocket on its tail. reply biscottigelato 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Recovering and reusing something that went up and down And something that went orbital at supersonic speed Is not even remotely the same universe McDonell Douglas have done up and down since 1992 SpaceX is the only entity that have recovered and reused any rocket parts after sending payloads orbital Wake me up when someone have done even a test that resembles orbital recovery Until then all the EDS in here has zero power over reality reply kortilla 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It’s the combination of the two that’s challenging though.

Is it due to the nature of chemicals it uses? reply nine_k 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Soot means carbon-rich fuel, like RP1, and a very fuel-rich mix. Most launches I ever saw had basically zero soot, and a clean exhaust of a well-balanced fuel &#x2F; oxidizer mix. Military rockets, and solid-fuel boosters like the kind the Shuttles used to use, indeed produce very visible exhaust, because they use heavy fuels, and sometimes heavier oxidizers, like nitric acid. This is because they need to be in the fueled state for a long time, ready to launch in seconds; this excludes more efficient but finicky cryogenic fuels used by large commercial rockets. The large plumes that you usually see the first few seconds when a rocket is blasting off a launch pad are mostly water vapor. The launch pad would be destroyed by the exhaust were it not cooled during the launch by large amounts of water, which gets evaporated instead of the concrete. reply hyperbrainer 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The water also serves the purpose of reducing reflecting acoustic energy. reply ggreer 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Several reasons. It&#x27;s filmed in daylight, so any flame or exhaust will be less visible. The rocket engine is much smaller than anything that would go on an orbital booster, so there&#x27;s less exhaust than what&#x27;d you see for an orbital launch. Also it&#x27;s looks like it&#x27;s a hydrolox rocket (using liquid hydrogen and oxygen as fuel), which has the least visible flame. The combustion product is almost entirely water vapor. Methalox (methane + liquid oxygen) is the next cleanest, which emits water, CO2, and a little bit of soot. Kerolox (RP-1 and oxygen) is the most common propellant used today, and it emits a significant amount of soot. Solid boosters put out the most visible exhaust, as burning APCP[1] emits solid particles of metal oxides. Also some rockets (mostly Russian, Chinese, and Indian) use unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine + dinitrogen tetroxide, which emits a reddish-orange exhaust.

They&#x27;re not optimizing for performance-at-all-costs on this. Ethanol&#x2F;oxygen is my guess. Blue, and also very little soot. reply lupusreal 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Probably methalox I think. It&#x27;s the trendy prop mix most reusable programs are settling on because it doesn&#x27;t coke up engines like kerosene and is easier to model in computers, and doesn&#x27;t cause metallurgical problems like hydrogen while being much more dense. Alcohol isn&#x27;t impossible but seems unlikely to me because that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;d want for the full scale rocket they&#x27;re presumably working towards. reply ggreer 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Hydrogen engines aren&#x27;t always pink. The exhaust color depends on the ratio of oxidizer to fuel. The Space Shuttle&#x27;s main engines were hydrolox, but their exhaust had almost no pink&#x2F;red. It&#x27;s hard to say for sure, but I lean towards Honda&#x27;s rocket using hydrogen. Honda has experience with it. They use hydrogen in their fuel cell vehicles, and their press release from 2021 mentions using hydrogen for rockets.[1] I&#x27;m pretty sure both fuel and oxidizer are cryogenic, because when the rocket lands it vents from several areas (most likely separate tanks). That would rule out ethanol or methanol as the fuel. I don&#x27;t see any secondary exhaust from a gas generator, and staged combustion would be something to brag about (and much higher thrust), so my guess is that it&#x27;s an expander cycle. Expander cycle engines require a fuel that boils easily, so it would have to be fueled by propane, methane, or hydrogen. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s propane, as the only propane&#x2F;lox rocket I&#x27;ve seen has orange exhaust.[2] If Honda poached some engineers from Mitsubishi, I could see them going with a hydrolox expander cycle, as that&#x27;s what the H family of rockets use. The only thing that doesn&#x27;t line up with hydrogen is the low thrust given the propellant consumption. Based on the claimed wet&#x2F;dry mass (1,312kg&#x2F;900kg), they used at most 412kg of propellant. Flight duration was 56.6 seconds, so that&#x27;s an average of 7.28kg of propellant per second. If the stated wet&#x2F;dry mass is correct and the rocket used up all of its fuel, then the rocket&#x27;s thrust was around 13kN at the start and around 7kN near the end. Let&#x27;s say it averaged 10kN. Force equals mass flow rate times exhaust velocity. So 10kN divided by 7.28kg&#x2F;sec is 1.374 km&#x2F;s. Divide by standard Earth gravity and you get 140 seconds, which is pathetic for a rocket. It could be that they only used a small fraction of the available propellant, or they had a poor nozzle design, or the engine was throttled very low and was therefore less efficient. If we assume the test flight only used 40% of the available propellant, then we&#x27;d get a flow rate of 2.9kg&#x2F;sec and a specific impulse of 352 seconds. But that sort of assumption can be used to come up with any Isp. Still, I think it&#x27;s using either hydrogen or methane as fuel. Nothing else fits with the video. 1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;global.honda&#x2F;en&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;c210930beng.html 2.

All engines on 105% can lift the rocket, so if you want to land while the tanks are nearly empty you need to be able to get to less than 1&#x2F;10th of your thrust. Turning off engines only gets you so far- the Space Shuttle engine could throttle between 67% and 109% of rated power but if you only have 1&#x2F;3 engines on you can only get as low as 22% power. One major reason for this is the mixing plate at the top of the combustor. Fuel and oxygen are distributed to tiny nozzles which mix together. The better the mixing, the more stable the burn. If you get unstable burning -eg momentarily better mixing in one area- it will cause a pressure disturbance which will further alter the burning power in different areas of the combustion chamber. At low throttle, this can be enough to cause the engine to turn off entirely. Fluid simulations have made a huge difference. It&#x27;s now possible to throttle engines down to 5% because mixing is much more stable (manufacturing improvements in the nozzles have also helped) and combustion is more protected from pressure variations. The extra stability also just makes it easier to control a rocket period. Less thrust variation to confuse with drag properties, less bouncing, better sensor data. reply bumby 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] So I’m assuming the simulations lead to better controls software and&#x2F;or mechanical nozzle designs? Similar to how CFD leads to more efficient vehicle aerodynamics? I guess I’m trying to connect the dots on how a simulation improves the actual vehicle dynamics. reply hwillis 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There is some improvement in vehicle control, but the biggest impact was inside the engine. Controlling the vehicle at transonic speeds benefits a lot from simulation- control inversion is an example. When grid find pass the sound barrier, the flow through the holes of the grid becomes choked off by shockwaves, and the fin starts acting like it was solid and sideways. Since it&#x27;s effectively pointed 90 degrees off, it acts like its reversed. Knowing when, how intensely, and how turning affects that is important. Simulation also helps you find unexpected places where flows may unexpectedly become super&#x2F;subsonic and cause torque. Experimenting at these speeds is... hard. Simulation inside the engine can find resonances, show where shockwaves propagate, and show you how to build injectors (pressure, spray etc) so they are less affected by the path of reflections. Optimizing things like that smoothly along a range of velocities and pressures without a computer is not very feasible, and you need a minimum of computing power before you start converging to accurate results. The unpredictability of turbulence means low-resolution simulations will behave very differently. reply Out_of_Characte 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] the poster above was very conservative in his metrics and throtteling requirements. Modern pressure vessels can reach 5% empty mass, thats a factor of 20 Rockets have stages, a good approximate is to stage half your rocket to get rid of the most empty mass. This also means your first stage has to have double the thrust to lift itself and its stage. Now you&#x27;re at a factor of 40 just to hover. Now you actually have to take off, usually around 1.2 to 1.4 thrust to weight. So a more realistic scenario means your rocket engine has to throttle down to exactly 2% power while the laval nozzle is optimised for takeoff thrust only. reply briandw 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Rocket engines struggle to throttle down to low levels due to combustion instability, injector dynamics, and turbopump limitations. Here are some stats on minimum throttle levels: SpaceX Merlin 1D: ~40% Rocketdyne F-1 (Saturn V): ~70% Space Shuttle Main Engine (RS-25): ~67% Blue Origin BE-4: ~20–25% Falcon 9 does the &quot;hover slam&quot; where they have to turn off the engine exactly at touch down, or the rocket starts to go back up again. Throttle is too high for the weight of the booster at that point in flight. reply 93po 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Also didnt spacex do reuse without throttling and only having on&#x2F;off? reply Tuna-Fish 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] They do throttle, and quite low compared to other comparable engines, but they still cannot throttle an engine below 1 TWR when the stage is near empty. Meaning that they cannot hover a stage, either the engine is on and the stage is accelerating upwards, or it&#x27;s off and it&#x27;s accelerating downwards. (And you cannot rapidly turn engines on and off.) So they need to &quot;hoverslam&quot;, that is, arrive at the landing pad rapidly decelerating so that their altitude hits zero just as their speed hits zero. This was thought to be very hard, but I don&#x27;t think SpaceX has lost a stage due to estimation failure there. It helps that there is significant throttle range and fairly rapid throttle response on the engines, so they can have some slack. (Plan to decelerate at 2.5g for the last ~20s or so, with the ability to do anything between ~1.5g to 4g, so you can adjust throttle based on measured landing speed.) Their Superheavy has more engines, allowing them to bring the TWR below 1, enabling hovering. reply timschmidt 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] No. SpaceX&#x27;s Merlin engines use a single https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pintle_injector which has excellent throttling capabilities. reply czbond 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] @roshdodd - Is there a modern reference&#x2F;book that covers the design of such systems? reply softfalcon 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Google &quot;Lars Blackmore&quot;, &quot;GFOLD&quot;, &quot;Mars Landing&quot;, and work through the references They linked details to look into in their original post. reply hinkley 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I recall hearing SpaceX cite manufacturing improvements as well.

A fast, low-power CPU that can access more than 4gb and is friendly to customization seems to me to be a recent development. reply morganherlocker 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; so now the main problem is building the hardware, there are a lot of solutions for the software part. While cool and all, this type of sim is a tiny, tiny slice of the software stack, and not the most difficult by a long shot. For one, you need software to control the actual hardware, that runs on said hardware&#x27;s specific CPU(s) stack AND in sim (making an off the shelf sim a lot less useful). Orbital&#x2F;newtonian physics are not trivial to implement, but they are relatively simple compared to the software that handles integration with physical components, telemetry, command, alerting, path optimization, etc. etc. The phrase &quot;reality has a surprising amount of detail&quot; applies here - it takes a lot of software to model complex hardware correctly, and even more to control it safely. reply rvnx 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Certainly not a trivial problem I totally agree, but still significantly easier than Von Braun with his paper calculations. reply xeromal 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] SpaceX showed it was possible and also a crappy place to work means those knowledgeable people go work elsewhere for less work and more money. inb4 blue origin &#x2F; DC-X did it first reply bryanlarsen 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Actually, the DC-X did it first, in 1993.

Pintle injectors are very good for throttling. &gt; Better materials to handle stress for flip over manover etc without added weight We&#x27;re still using the same materials- good ol inconel and aluminum. However 3d printing has made a pretty big difference in engines. More rockets use carbon fiber, but that isn&#x27;t new exactly and the main parts are still the same variety of aluminum etc. Titanium has become more common, but is still pretty specialized- the increased availability was probably the biggest factor but improved cutting toolings (alloys and coatings) and tools (bigger, faster, less vibration) have also made a big difference. reply kurthr 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Proof of concept. It&#x27;s a lot easier to do something, if you know it can be done. reply benjiro 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Its more about money. If you know that something can be done, and there is a potential market for such a project, it then becomes easier to get the funding. Chicken or the egg... One thing we also need to point out, is that SpaceX uses like 80% of their yearly launches, for their own communication &#x2F; sat service. This gave a incentive for that investment. Is the same reason why, despite SpaceX throwing those things up constantly, there really is a big lag of competitors with reusable rockets. Its not that they where &#x2F; not able to quickly get the same tech going. They simply have less market, vs what SpaceX does non-stop. So the investments are less, what in time means less fast development. SpaceX is a bit of a strange company, partially because they used a lot of the public funds to just throw shit at the wall, and see what sticks. This resulted in them caring less if a few rockets blew up, as long as they got the data for the next one with less flaws. It becomes harder when there is more oversight of that money, or risk averse investors. Then you really want to be sure that thing goes up and come back down into one piece from the first go. A lot of projects funding are heavily based upon the first or second try of something, and then (sometimes unwisely) funding is pulled if it was not a perfect success story. reply PaulHoule 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Even before SpaceX started launching their own satellites in huge numbers they had a business model where they were selling the launch, not the rocket, and selling it at a fixed price, so if some small refinement saved them 5% on launch costs it went to their pockets so they had an incentive to make those small refinements. Dragon 9 was based on conservative and boring technology but it was cost optimized before it was reusable, then reusability crushed the competition. For that matter, Starship is boring. &quot;Throw at the wall and see what sticks&quot; isn&#x27;t &quot;trying a bunch of crazy stuff&quot; but trying a bunch of low and medium risk things. For instance, development of the Space Shuttle thermal tiles was outrageously expensive and resulted in a system that was outrageously expensive to maintain. They couldn&#x27;t change it because lives were at stake. With Starship they can build a thermal protection system which is 90% adequate and make little changes that get it up to 100% adequate and then look at optimizing weight, speed of reuse and all that. If some of them burn up it is just money since there won&#x27;t be astronauts riding it until it is perfected. reply imtringued 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Starship has exactly the opposite development strategy to what made the Falcon 9 so successful. Calling a complete change in process and philosophy &quot;boring&quot; appears to be hubris. Falcon 9 didn&#x27;t have three versions of which two were obsolete. Falcon 9 didn&#x27;t put optional goals on the critical path, which are now delaying and preventing commercial launches. reply kurthr 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I agree, a lot is about money, but it&#x27;s not like Honda is raising external funds.

This is where I think the business acumen came into play. Because the govt is self-insured, it allowed SpaceX to pass the high risk off to the taxpayer. Once the tech matured, the risk was low enough to be palatable for private industry use. And FWIW, I don’t mean that as disparaging to SpaceX, just an acknowledgment of the risk dynamics. reply IncreasePosts 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Bezos wants to do satellite internet just like spaceX, owns a rocket company, but is still going to buy rides on 3rd party non-reusable rockets reply PaulHoule 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Also psychology and politics kept people from following the easy path. The Space Shuttle was wrong in so many ways, not least that it was a &quot;pickup truck&quot; as opposed to a dedicated manned vehicle (with appropriate safety features) or a dedicated cargo vehicle. Because they couldn&#x27;t do unmanned tests they were stuck with the barely reusable thermal tiles and couldn&#x27;t replace them with something easier to reuse (or safer!) Attempts at second generation reusable vehicles failed because rather than &quot;solving reuse&quot; they were all about single-stage to orbit (SSTO) [2] and aerospike engines and exotic composite materials that burned up the money&#x2F;complexity&#x2F;risk&#x2F;technology budgets. There was a report that came out towards the end of the SDI [3] phase that pointed out the path that SpaceX followed with Dragon 9 where you could make rather ordinary rockets and reuse the first stage but expend the second because the first stage is most of the expense. They thought psychology and politics would preclude that and that people would be seduced by SSTO, aerospikes, composites, etc. Funny though out of all the design studies NASA did for the Shuttle and for heavy lift vehicles inspired by the O&#x27;Neill colony idea, there was a sketch of a &quot;fly back booster&quot; based on the Saturn V that would have basically been &quot;Super Heavy&quot; that was considered in 1979 that, retrospectively, could have given us Starship by 1990 or so. But no, we were committed to the Space Shuttle because boy the Soviet Union was intimidated by our willingness and ability to spend on senseless boondoggles! [1] The first few times the shuttle went up they were afraid the tiles would get damaged and something like the Columbia accident would happen, they made some minor changes to get them to stick better and stopped worrying, at least in public. It took 100 launches for a failure mode than affects 1% of launches to actually happen.

That&#x27;s a huge engineering difference, roughly like the difference between a car and a helicopter. The Falcon 9 was also 4x taller, meaning 16x more force to correct a lean.

The Honda test rocket only went to an altitude of 300 meters. It&#x27;s been possible to propulsively land rockets from such low altitudes for decades, e.g., McDonnell Douglas DC-X test in 1996. (And ofc, if you&#x27;re just talking about re-use for any landing method, the space shuttle first reused the solid rockets and the orbiter in 1981.) Reusable, propulsively landed stages for rockets capable of putting payloads into Earth orbit is stupendously harder. The speeds involved are like 10-100x higher than these little hops.

The kilogram is the only standard unit to include an SI prefix (kilo-) as part of its name. The gram (10−3 kg) is an SI derived unit of mass. However, the names of all SI mass units are based on gram, rather than on kilogram; thus 103 kg is a megagram (106 g), not a kilokilogram. The tonne (t) is an SI-compatible unit of mass equal to a megagram (Mg), or 10^3 kg. The unit is in common use for masses above about 10^3 kg and is often used with SI prefixes. For example, a gigagram (Gg) or 10^9 g is 10^3 tonnes, commonly called a kilotonne.

I owned a Miata and wanted to own an S2k before moving up to the Boxster, but for today&#x27;s asking prices, it just didn&#x27;t make sense. reply wmeredith 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I&#x27;m fairly certain that an S2000&#x27;s current worth is a rounding error in rocket-science economics. reply bookofjoe 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] $18,450: not bad! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cargurus.com&#x2F;Cars&#x2F;listing&#x2F;409969476?sourceContex... reply kreetx 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I&#x27;d still send the Civic.

I probably wouldn&#x27;t still be driving it, but it has led to a long association with Honda&#x2F;Acura products. If rockets became as common as cars, what kind of accidents would we see? And would insurers insure them? reply jancsika 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If you&#x27;d still be driving it then how was the resale value relevant? reply nsriv 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I think he means that the cost to repair exceeded the market value of the car. As a recent victim of something similar with an 09 Accord, I feel the pain. Was the perfect car. reply jancsika 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I&#x27;m supposing he meant that the body damage was the only damage, and that the known cost to repair the body exceeded the market value. But OP states that, body aside, the car&#x27;s condition was suitable to deliver at least two more decades of driving time. Buying a different used Civic at market value would introduce an unknown, unbound cost of repairs to reach that goal. Unless you&#x27;re a mechanic it&#x27;s essentially gambling. Or* it&#x27;s a new vehicle-- in which case it will cost vastly more than the cost of the body repairs. I suppose I understand why the market is relevant-- if it were $1 then it would be worth the gamble. But given OP&#x27;s goals and foreknowledge of the car&#x27;s condition, I don&#x27;t understand why market value would create a hard limit against paying for the repairs. That foreknowledge is worth at least a few hundred dollars, probably way more if you factor in time to find another car and risk of it being in ill-repair. Edit: (Not to mention the depth of knowledge since OP had been driving it for nearly a decade already!) Edit: Plus the fact that OP would have run this car into the ground. So while market value still plays some role, resale value does not. reply nsriv 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It comes down to insurance and salvage titles mostly. In PA, the vehicle I have experience with was valued by insurance at $11.5k, minus a $500 deductible, so $11k. That value determination was made by the insurance company by market factors, which is why market value comes into play. Looking around at comparable used vehicles of same make, model, year, mileage, I found that to be fair price. The cost to repair from multiple shops within transportable distance (important consideration as I&#x27;m sure someone somewhere could have done it for less) was $16k. To get it to an ugly but functional state was about $10k, which would have to be paid out of pocket. Even if repaired to &quot;roadworthy&quot; condition, it would need to be reinspected and if deemed to be roadworthy would hold a salvage title, meaning insurance would go through the roof, my liability coverage would be dropped, and the car could not be resold. If not deemed roadworthy, more cost. Needless to say, I considered the car totaled and used the $11k for a down payment towards another Honda. reply Finnucane 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Insurance won&#x27;t pay for it. But it&#x27;s probably still cheaper to fix than buy a new car (I had a &#x27;99 CRV that I drove for 17 years). reply lampiaio 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] You should watch Pontiac Moon!

Both Hondas I have owned had complete transmission failures. Full disclosure, I bought them used (as I do all my cars) with unknown maintenance history and I did get a few years out of each of them so it still worked out &quot;ok&quot; in an economic sense. The engines do seem pretty bulletproof. But I would not buy another, at least not one with an automatic transmission. reply officeplant 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I find the common problem with automatics is their service time scale. Bad car owners often forget to do oil changes often enough and those are only 3.5-10k miles apart depending on climate&#x2F;oil type&#x2F;etc. Which means services that happen every 50-75k miles or greater get left to people that actually maintain service histories and timely maintenance. Personal example buying a used car with 60k miles that had some idle&#x2F;start issues at times but generally ran well. Everything seemed to be serviced in a timely manner but the spark plugs were still the originals. Those spark plugs have a generous &quot;100,000 mile&quot; service interval. I pulled the originals and sure enough they weren&#x27;t in the greatest shape. $40 later I never had start&#x2F;idle issues again for the remaining time I owned the car. reply caycep 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That was a known thing from the &#x27;00s decade cars.

This... is at least a decade behind that, if they&#x27;re serious. Note that they don&#x27;t appear to have an orbital engine yet—this thing&#x27;s far too small, it has to be some kind of one-off for this demo flight. Most of the competition leaped directly to testing an engine they were developing for orbital launches, in their suborbital hops. reply nine_k 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] I assume this rocket is not a part of some orbital program. It&#x27;s more like the SpaceX&#x27;s Hopper [1], intended to test the control algorithms and such. A booster &#x2F; orbital vehicle, when it appears, should have very different characteristics. I can even imagine that some kind of compatibility standard may arise, allowing to stack custom orbital vehicles to reusable boosters, much like the standardized buses for smaller satellites that exist today. [1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;starship-spacex.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Starhopper reply perihelions 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; &quot;competition leaped directly to testing an engine they were developing for orbital launches&quot; SpaceX&#x27; Starhopper was an orbital Raptor engine. The *test vehicle* wasn&#x27;t orbital, but, it&#x27;s testing the in-development orbital engine and associated plumbing under flight conditions (which is useful, because... well you can see the various ways Starhopper failed at the start). Likewise, Grasshopper before that, in 2012-3, was a single Merlin engine (the Falcon 9 has, eponymously, 9). SpaceX never flew a suborbital hop with anything other than an engine intended for orbital flight. I think if Honda had an orbital-class reusable engine at the hardware stage, that&#x27;d be flying that to test it as much as possible. I&#x27;m not aware of any of the competitors doing otherwise. This is signalling they don&#x27;t (yet?) have one. edit: Or LandSpace, whose 10 km suborbital hop last year flew one of the methane engines their orbital vehicle has nine of. reply nine_k 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] From the press release: «Honda rocket research is still in the fundamental research phase, and no decisions have been made regarding commercialization of these rocket technologies».

Seems like it could save a bit on fuel and maybe even a stage. reply generalizations 10 hours ago | parent | next [–] Short answer: you still need a complex vehicle to finish the orbit insertion after getting thrown, and now you have the added complexity of designing your (smaller) rocket to a) survive a massive g-force while being thrown and b) fit into the catapult sling. So far the tradeoffs haven&#x27;t been worth it.

tree viewer, written in Rust. Inspired by the command line program tree , with a powerful interactive mode. An interactive overview of lstr 's project structure... using lstr . Philosophy Fast: Runs directory scans in parallel by default to maximize speed on modern hardware. Minimalist: Provides essential features without the bloat. The core experience is clean and uncluttered. Interactive: An optional TUI mode for fluid, keyboard-driven exploration. Features High-performance: Scans directories in parallel to be as fast as possible. Classic and interactive modes: Use lstr for a classic tree -like view, or launch lstr interactive for a fully interactive TUI. Rich information display (optional): Display file-specific icons with --icons (requires a Nerd Font). Show file permissions with -p . Show file sizes with -s . Git Integration: Show file statuses ( Modified , New , Untracked , etc.) directly in the tree with the -G flag. Smart filtering: Respects your .gitignore files with the -g flag. Control recursion depth ( -L ) or show only directories ( -d ). Installation You need the Rust toolchain installed on your system to build lstr . Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/bgreenwell/lstr.git cd lstr Build and install using Cargo: # This compiles in release mode and copies the binary to ~/.cargo/bin cargo install --path . Usage lstr [OPTIONS] [PATH] lstr interactive [OPTIONS] [PATH] Note that PATH defaults to the current directory ( . ) if not specified. Option Description -a , --all List all files and directories, including hidden ones. --color &lt;WHEN&gt; Specify when to use color output ( always , auto , never ). -d , --dirs-only List directories only, ignoring all files. -g , --gitignore Respect .gitignore and other standard ignore files. -G , --git-status Show git status for files and directories. --icons Display file-specific icons; requires a Nerd Font . -L , --level &lt;LEVEL&gt; Maximum depth to descend. -p , --permissions Display file permissions (Unix-like systems only). -s , --size Display the size of files. --expand-level &lt;LEVEL&gt; Interactive mode only: Initial depth to expand the interactive tree. Interactive mode Launch the TUI with lstr interactive [OPTIONS] [PATH] . Keyboard controls Key(s) Action ↑ / k Move selection up. ↓ / j Move selection down. Enter Context-aware action: - If on a file: Open it in the default editor ( $EDITOR ). - If on a directory: Toggle expand/collapse. q / Esc Quit the application normally. Ctrl + s Shell integration: Quits and prints the selected path to stdout. Examples 1. List the contents of the current directory lstr 2. Explore a project interactively, ignoring gitignored files lstr interactive -g --icons 3. Display a directory with file sizes and permissions (classic view) lstr -sp 4. See the git status of all files in a project lstr -aG 5. Start an interactive session with all data displayed lstr interactive -gG --icons -s -p Piping and shell interaction The classic view mode is designed to work well with other command-line tools via pipes ( | ). Interactive fuzzy finding with fzf This is a powerful way to instantly find any file in a large project. lstr -a -g --icons | fzf fzf will take the tree from lstr and provide an interactive search prompt to filter it. Paging large trees with less or bat If a directory is too large to fit on one screen, pipe the output to a pager . # Using less (the -R flag preserves color) lstr -L 10 | less -R # Using bat (a modern pager that understands colors) lstr --icons | bat Changing directories with lstr You can use lstr as a visual cd command. Add the following function to your shell's startup file (e.g., ~/.bashrc , ~/.zshrc ): # A function to visually change directories with lstr lcd () { # Run lstr and capture the selected path into a variable. # The TUI will draw on stderr, and the final path will be on stdout. local selected_dir selected_dir= " $( lstr interactive -g --icons ) " # If the user selected a path (and didn't just quit), `cd` into it. # Check if the selection is a directory. if [[ -n " $selected_dir " &amp;&amp; -d " $selected_dir " ]] ; then cd " $selected_dir " fi } After adding this and starting a new shell session (or running source ~/.bashrc ), you can simply run: lcd This will launch the lstr interactive UI. Navigate to the directory you want, press Ctrl+s , and your shell's current directory will instantly change. Performance and concurrency By default, lstr uses a parallel directory walker to maximize speed on multi-core systems. This parallelism is managed by the excellent rayon thread pool, which is used internally by lstr 's directory traversal engine. For advanced use cases, such as benchmarking or limiting CPU usage, you can control the number of threads by setting the RAYON_NUM_THREADS environment variable before running the command. To force single-threaded (serial) execution: RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1 lstr . Inspiration The philosophy and functionality of lstr are heavily inspired by the excellent C-based tree command line program. This project is an attempt to recreate that classic utility in modern, safe Rust.

I&#x27;m the author of `lstr`. I&#x27;ve always loved the classic Linux `tree` command for its simplicity, but I often found myself wanting more modern features like interactivity and Git integration. So, I decided to build my own version in Rust with a philosophy of being fast, minimalist, and interactive. It was also an excuse to help learn more about Rust\! Here&#x27;s a quick look at the interactive mode: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;bgreenwell&#x2F;lstr&#x2F;main&#x2F;asset... I&#x27;ve just released v0.2.0 with some features I think this community might find useful: * **Interactive TUI Mode:** You can launch it with `lstr interactive`. It allows for keyboard-driven navigation, expanding&#x2F;collapsing directories, and opening files in your default editor. * **Git Status Integration:** Using the `-G` flag, `lstr` will show the Git status of every file and directory right in the tree output. * **Shell Integration:** This is my favorite feature. In interactive mode, you can press `Ctrl+s` to quit and have `lstr` print the selected path to stdout. This lets you pipe it into other commands or use it as a visual `cd`. For example, you can add this function to your `.bashrc`&#x2F;`.zshrc`: ```bash lcd() { local selected_path selected_path=&quot;$(lstr interactive -gG)&quot; if [[ -n &quot;$selected_path&quot; &amp;&amp; -d &quot;$selected_path&quot; ]]; then cd &quot;$selected_path&quot; fi } ``` Then just run `lcd` to visually pick a directory and jump to it. It also supports file-type icons (via Nerd Fonts), file sizes, permissions, and respects your `.gitignore`. The project is open-source and I would love to get your feedback. GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bgreenwell&#x2F;lstr Crates.io: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;lstr Thanks for checking it out! berkes 2 hours ago | next [–] I really love all the &quot;modern&quot; takes on classic tools by the Rust community. I&#x27;m using eza (aka exa), aliased as ls, which has &quot;tree&quot; built in (aliased as lt), amongst others, as replacement for &quot;ls&quot; and it&#x27;s one of my biggest production boosts in daily commandline use. Because eza has the tree built in, and the tree is also insanely fast, I won&#x27;t be needing this tool - yet. Maybe one day the interactive mode will pull me over. Congrats on releasing. And kudo&#x27;s to how well you&#x27;ve released it: solid README, good description, good-looking gifs with exactly the right feature highlights reply fer 58 minutes ago | parent | next [–] On interactive mode &quot;ls tree&quot; tools, an interesting one is broot. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Canop&#x2F;broot reply ipdashc 7 hours ago | prev | next [–] Seems quite cool!

I’ll have to see about fixing it! reply yonatan8070 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people use asciinema to record and share terminal recordings, it works quite well reply sdegutis 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I didn&#x27;t notice, I was too busy seeing how impressive and useful this tool is. And with fuzzy matching built in? Just amazing. Good job OP. reply drabbiticus 7 hours ago | prev | next [–] First off, the display looks great! Second off, I didn&#x27;t realize how deep the dep tree would be for this type of program -- 141 total! So much of it is the url crate, itself a dep of the git crate, but there&#x27;s a bunch of others too. I&#x27;m just getting into learning Rust -- is this typical of Rust projects or perhaps typical of TUI projects in general? (EDIT to strikeout) ~~The binary is also 53M as a result whereas &#x2F;usr&#x2F;sbin&#x2F;tree is 80K on my machine -- not really a problem on today&#x27;s storage, but very roughly 500-1000x different in size isn&#x27;t nothing.~~ Maybe it&#x27;s linking-related? I don&#x27;t know how to check really. (EDIT: many have pointed out that you can run `cargo build --release` with other options to get a much smaller binary. Thanks for teaching me!) reply JoshTriplett 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] &gt; The binary is also 53M That&#x27;s a debug binary, and the vast majority of that is debug symbols. A release build of this project is 4.3M, an order of magnitude smaller. Also, compiling out the default features of the git2 crate eliminates several dependencies and reduces it further to 3.6M. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bgreenwell&#x2F;lstr&#x2F;pull&#x2F;5 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;git2-rs&#x2F;pull&#x2F;1168 Stripping the binary further improves it to 2.9M, and some further optimizations get it to 2.2M without any compromise to performance. (You can get it smaller by optimizing for size, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that unless you really do value size more than performance.) reply esafak 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] No offense, but 4.3MB is huge for what it does. Most shells take less space than that! Where&#x27;s all the bloat coming from? reply koito17 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Most shells take less space than that! Most shells dynamically link to a runtime your OS provides &quot;for free&quot;. The 4.3 MiB binary in question is bundling the Rust runtime and its dependencies. For reference, a statically-compiled C++ &quot;Hello, World&quot; is 2.2 MiB after stripping. % cat hello.nix { pkgs ? import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; { crossSystem = &quot;aarch64-linux&quot;; } }: pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation { name = &quot;hello-static&quot;; src = pkgs.writeText &quot;hello.cpp&quot; &#x27;&#x27; #include &lt;iostream&gt; int main() { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello, World!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; return 0; } &#x27;&#x27;; dontUnpack = true; buildInputs = [ pkgs.glibc.static ]; buildPhase = &quot;$CXX -std=c++17 -static -o hello $src&quot;; installPhase = &quot;mkdir -p $out&#x2F;bin; cp hello $out&#x2F;bin&#x2F;&quot;; } % nix-build hello.nix ... % wc -c result&#x2F;bin&#x2F;hello 2224640 result&#x2F;bin&#x2F;hello reply esafak 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] 2.2MiB for &quot;Hello, World&quot;? I must be getting old... The executable takes 33KB in C, 75KB in nim. reply koito17 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] By switching to e.g. musl, you can go down to a single megabyte ;) But in all seriousness, my example is quite cherrypicked, since nobody will actually statically link glibc. And even if they did, one can make use of link-time optimization to remove lots of patches of unused code. Note that this is the same strategy one would employ to debloat their Rust binaries. (Use LTO, don&#x27;t aggressively inline code, etc.) reply 3836293648 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] We just have large standard libraries now reply wahern 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; Most shells dynamically link to a runtime your OS provides &quot;for free&quot; Rust binaries also dynamically link to and rely on this runtime. reply o11c 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] For reference, some statically-linked shells on my system: 2288K &#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash-static (per manual, &quot;too big and too slow&quot;) 1936K &#x2F;bin&#x2F;busybox-static (including tools not just the shell) 192K &#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib&#x2F;klibc&#x2F;bin&#x2F;mksh 2456K zsh-static For comparison, some dynamically-linked binaries (some old) 804K .&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash-3.2 888K .&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash-4.0 908K .&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash-4.1 956K .&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash-4.2 1016K .&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash-4.3 1092K .&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash-4.4 1176K .&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash-5.0 1208K .&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash-5.1 1236K &#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash (5.2) 124K &#x2F;bin&#x2F;dash 1448K &#x2F;bin&#x2F;ksh93 (fattest when excluding libc!) 292K &#x2F;bin&#x2F;mksh 144K &#x2F;bin&#x2F;posh 424K &#x2F;bin&#x2F;yash 848K &#x2F;bin&#x2F;zsh (The reason I don&#x27;t have static binaries handy is because they no longer run on modern systems. As long as you aren&#x27;t using shitty libraries, dynamic binaries are more portable and reliable, contrary to internet &quot;wisdom&quot;.) reply JoshTriplett 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Among the features it has: an interactive terminal GUI, threaded parallel directory walking, and git repository support.

Not GUI reply have-a-break 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I feel like that&#x27;s just the result of having a native package manager making natural bloat and a compiler which hasn&#x27;t had decades of work. reply CGamesPlay 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Likely needs features tuned. I compared Eza, similarly in Rust, and it&#x27;s 1.6 MiB compiled.

I&#x27;ll try with `panic = &quot;abort&quot;` for our next release, thanks for the reminder. reply fabrice_d 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] You are probably looking at a debug build. On Linux, a release build (cargo build -r) is ~4.3M, and down to ~3.5M once stripped. This could be reduced further with some tricks applied to the release build profile. reply getcrunk 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Great catch! Comments mentioned getting it down to ~2MB but that’s still humongous. If you just think about how roughly (napkin math) 2MB can be 100k loc, that’s nuts reply arlort 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Is It though? You won&#x27;t get it on an embedded device (maybe) but you could install a thousand of these tools and barely even notice the space being taken up on most machines reply getcrunk 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I think that’s a lame argument. First because it’s kind of a fallacy. Size is absolute not relative to something. Especially for software. No one thinks of software size primarily in the context of their disk space. Further I think everyone keeps getting larger and larger memory because software keeps getting more and more bloated. I remember when 64gb iPhone was more than enough (I don’t take pictures so just apps and data) Now my 128 is getting uncomfortable due to the os and app sizes. My next phone likely will be a 256 reply ghosty141 39 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; No one thinks of software size primarily in the context of their disk space. This is wrong. The reason why many old tools are so small was because you had far less space. If you have a 20tb harddrive you wouldn&#x27;t care about whether ls took up 1kb or 2mb, on a 1gb harddrive it matters&#x2F;ed much more. Optimization takes time, I&#x27;m sure if OP wanted he could shrink the binary size by quite a lot but doing so has its costs and nowadays its rarely worth paying that since nobody even notices wether a program is 2kb or 2mb. It doesn&#x27;t matter anymore in the age of 1TB bootdrives. reply hnlmorg 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I’m usually the first to complain about bloat but your counterpoints to the GPs “lame arguments” are themselves, fallacies. &gt; First because it’s kind of a fallacy. Size is absolute not relative to something. Especially for software. No one thinks of software size primarily in the context of their disk space. That’s exactly how most people think about file sizes. When your disk is full, you don’t delete the smallest files first. You delete the biggest. &gt; Further I think everyone keeps getting larger and larger memory because software keeps getting more and more bloated. RAM sizes have actually stagnated over the last decade. &gt; I remember when 64gb iPhone was more than enough (I don’t take pictures so just apps and data) Now my 128 is getting uncomfortable due to the os and app sizes. My next phone likely will be a 256 That’s because media sizes increase, not executable sizes. And people do want higher resolution cameras, higher definition videos, improved audio quality, etc. These are genuinely desirable features. Couple that with improved internet bandwidth allowing for content providers to push higher bitrate media, however the need to still locally cache media. reply nicoburns 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; That’s because media sizes increase, not executable sizes. Part of it is app sizes on mobile. But it&#x27;s apps in the 200mb - 2gb range that are the problem, not ones that single-digit megabytes. reply dotancohen 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] So bloated software is motivating you to spend more for the larger capacity phone? What incentive does Apple have to help iOS devs get package sizes down, then? reply vlovich123 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] When you include the code for all the dependency features this uses, you probably do end up close to 100k LoC net, no? reply ethan_smith 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Try `cargo build --release --no-default-features` to get a much smaller binary (~5-10MB) - Rust statically links dependencies but supports conditional compilation for optional features. reply aystatic 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Glancing at the Cargo.toml, the package doesn&#x27;t define any features anyways. `cargo b --no-default-features` only applies to the packages you&#x27;re building, not their dependencies -- that would lead to very unpredictable behavior reply w108bmg 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] Really appreciate all the comments and useful feedback (first Rust package). Especially ways to reduce the size of the binary! reply rewgs 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] This looks awesome! Right up my alley. Side-note: what theme are you using in the linked gif? It&#x27;s right in the middle of my two favorite themes, onedark and gruvbox. reply sdegutis 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] So after writing this to learn Rust, what are your thoughts on Rust? What do you especially like and dislike about it, or what were you surprised about? reply w108bmg 6 hours ago | parent | next [–] I appreciate the ecosystem of packages that seem really well maintained. I don’t love the syntax and find Rust harder to read and learn so far compared to something like golang (I’m used to R which is not a compiled language but has a great dev community). I do love the compiler and support tools built into Cargo (fmt, clippy, etc.). reply sdegutis 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That&#x27;s been similar to my experience.

Take this library as an example. 0.1.0 was released in 2014 and it still hasn&#x27;t had a 1.0.0 release, is there an aversion to get to 1.0.0 in the rust community? reply liambigelow 1 hour ago | parent | next [–] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0ver.org&#x2F;#notable-zerover-projects reply liambigelow 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Serious answer: For some, they do change semi-often and don&#x27;t feel compelled to declare stability. In other cases, it&#x27;s a stable + widely used 0.x package, and bumping it to 1.0 usually implies _some_ kind of breaking change. (I don&#x27;t know if that _should_ be the case, but I know that if I see a dependency has bumped from 0.x to 1.0 I&#x27;m going to be cautious and wait to update it until I have more time). In general: People usually aren&#x27;t too concerned about it. reply sramsay64 24 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This list&#x27;s Zig as an entry, despite the Zig project having very clear plans[0] for a 1.0 release.

So in practice, everything is statically linked. reply pjmlp 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] A culture isse, as in the C++ world, of Apple and Microsoft ecosystems, shipping binary C++ libraries is a common business, even it is compiler version dependent. This is why Apple made such a big point of having a better ABI approach on Swift, after their experience with C++ and Objective-C. While on Microsoft side, you will notice that all talks from Victor Ciura on Rust conferences have dealing with ABI as one of the key points Microsoft is dealing with in the context of Rust adoption. reply eru 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Static linking also produces smaller binaries and lets you do link-time-optimisation. reply emidln 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Static linking doesn&#x27;t produce smaller binaries. You are literally adding the symbols from a library into your executable rather than simply mentioning them and letting the dynamic linker figure out how to map those symbols at runtime. The sum size of a dynamic binary plus the dynamic libraries may be larger than one static linked binary, but whether that holds for more static binaries (2, 3, or 100s) depends on the surface area your application uses of those libraries. It&#x27;s relatively common to see certain large libraries only dynamically linked, with the build going to great lengths to build certain libraries as shared objects with the executables linking them using a location-relative RPATH (using the $ORIGIN feature) to avoid the extra binary size bloat over large sets of binaries. reply IshKebab 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Static linking does produce smaller binaries when you bundle dependencies. You&#x27;re conflating two things - static vs dynamic linking, and bundled vs shared dependencies. They are often conflated because you can&#x27;t have shared dependencies with static linking, and bundling dynamically linked libraries is uncommon in FOSS Linux software. It&#x27;s very common on Windows or with commercial software on Linux though. reply guappa 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You know how the page cache works? Static linking makes it not work.

I don&#x27;t know of a sed equivalent, but I guess that would be easy to implement as Rust has good regex support (see ripgrep), and 90%+ of sed usage is search-and-replace. The other commands don&#x27;t look hard to implement and because they are not used as much, optimizing these is less of a priority. I don&#x27;t know about awk, it is a full programming language, but I guess it is far from an impossible task to implement. Now the real hard part is making a true, bug-for-bug compatible replacement of the GNU version of these tools, but while good to have, it is not strictly necessary. For example, Busybox is very popular, maybe even more so than GNU in terms of number of devices, and it has its own (likely simplified) version of grep, sed and awk. reply egorfine 10 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] What would be the point? reply wiz21c 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] FTA: &gt; Why bother working on this algorithm from the 90s that sees very little use today?

You can get smaller outputs from zstd in 1&#x2F;20th the time for many common inputs, or you can spend the same amount of time and get a significantly smaller output, and zstd decompression is again 20-50x faster depending. So the speed of your bzip2 implementation hardly seems worth arguing over. reply MBCook 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Sure there is: someone provided you bzip2 files.

Given the LLM could hallucinate anything anywhere you’d likely waste a ton of time. I suspect it would be faster to just try and write a new implementation based on the spec and debug that against the test suite. You’d likely be closer.

But point being, if you rewrote bzip2 using an equivalent to std::Vec, you&#x27;d end up in the same place. Unfortunately, the norm among C developers, especially in the past, was to open code most buffer manipulation, so you wind up with 1000 manually written overflow checks, some of which are wrong or outright missing, as opposed to a single check in a shared implementation. Indeed, even that Rust code had an off-by-one (in &quot;safe&quot; code), it just wasn&#x27;t considered a security issue because it would result in data corruption, not an overflow.

https://trifectatech.org/blog/bzip2-crate-switches-from-c-to-rust/|bzip2 crate switches from C to 100% rust - Trifecta Tech Foundation|bzip2 crate switches from C to 100% rust - Trifecta Tech Foundation Trifecta Tech Foundation Home Initiatives Time synchronization Privilege boundary Data compression Smart grid protocols News & blogs Technology Support us About bzip2 crate switches from C to 100% rust 2025-06-17 Author: Folkert de Vries bzip2-rs data compression Today we published bzip2 version 0.6.0 , which uses our rust implementation of the bzip2 algorithm, libbz2-rs-sys , by default. The bzip2 crate is now faster and easier to cross-compile. The libbz2-rs-sys crate can also be built as a C dynamic library, if you have a C project that would benefit from these improvements. Why though? Why bother working on this algorithm from the 90s that sees very little use today? The thing is that many protocols and libraries still need to support bzip2 to be compliant with their specification, so many project still, deep down in their dependency tree, depend on bzip2. We've used our experience from zlib-rs to modernize the bzip2 implementation. We've previously written about the implementation details of libbz2-rs-sys in "Translating bzip2 with c2rust" , now let's look at the benefits of this work. Improved performance Our rust implementation generally outperforms the C implementation, though there are a couple of cases where we only match C performance. We are not aware of any cases where we are substantially slower. For compression, we are a fair amount faster. For bzip2, the level indicates how much working memory is used. It doesn't influence performance by much, and for sample3.ref level 1 already allocates more memory than the file is large, so higher levels are irrelevant. name c (cpu cycles) rust (cpu cycles) Δ sample3.ref (level 1) 38.51M ± 77.03K 33.53M ± 90.52K -14.87% silesia-small.tar (level 1) 3.43G ± 2.06M 3.00G ± 6.31M -14.30% silesia-small.tar (level 9) 3.47G ± 4.86M 3.17G ± 4.43M - 9.66% For decompression there is a bit more of a spread, but we again see significant speedups across the board. name c (cpu cycles) rust (cpu cycles) Δ sample3.bz2 2.53M ± 30.08K 2.42M ± 8.95K - 4.48% sample1.bz2 9.63M ± 40.44K 8.86M ± 10.64K - 8.63% sample2.bz2 20.47M ± 55.28K 19.02M ± 36.13K - 7.67% dancing-color.ps.bz2 87.46M ± 481.02K 83.16M ± 548.86K - 5.17% re2-exhaustive.txt.bz2 1.89G ± 12.29M 1.76G ± 12.64M - 7.65% zip64support.tar.bz2 2.32G ± 12.09M 2.11G ± 15.42M -10.00% One caveat is that on our macOS benchmark machine we occasionally see some lower numbers for decompression. We are not sure what causes the variance, and measuring performance on macOS in a detailed way has turned out to be difficult (e.g there is no tool like perf to automate performance tracking that we could get to work). Enabling cross-compilation Cross-compilation of a rust project with C dependencies often works out of the box (because the cc crate tries to handle it), but when it doesn't the errors can be hard to debug. Similarly linking to system libraries can cause confusing and hard-to-reproduce issues. For bzip2, compilation to webassembly has long been an issue. By removing the C dependency and using rust code instead, the complications of compiling C just disappear: cross-compilation just works. Also building for windows or android just works. Besides providing a better experience for users, this change is also a major maintenance win. Symbols are not exported (by default) Using a C dependency means that its symbols are exported (so that a rust extern block can find them). The exported names can conflict when another dependency declares the same symbols. By default, libbz2-rs-sys does not export its symbols, which means that it will never conflict with other dependencies. If your rust project does need to emit the symbols, there is a feature flag to enable exporting symbols. Run tests with miri Writing a performant bzip2 implementation requires some unsafe code, and replicating the C interface in rust requires a lot more. Luckily we are able to run that code under MIRI. More importantly, higher-level libraries or applications that use bzip2 can now run with MIRI as well. Audit The audit found one logic bug (an off-by-one error), and fixed some limitations in our fuzzer. Beyond that, there were no significant findings (yay!). We do want to thank the reviewers from Radically Open Security , specifically Christian Reitter, for sharing their fuzzing experience. The full audit report can be found here . Conclusion The bzip2 crate is faster now. You can go back to never having to think about it.

I would only need to stop at a level 2 charger every other week or so. 2 weeks if I don’t need to go to the city. My work is nearby a level 2 charger and places in the city even have level 3 charging. And that is worst case scenario getting only 2 miles an hour off a standard wall outlet as opposed to the optimum 4 or 5 miles. I feel far more confident about battery range. The 3-4 trips that are more than 250 miles round trip a year are fine if you plan the route and are okay stopping for half an hour. With kids and a dog a stop in a ICE vehicle could easily take that long anyway. reply Consider applying for YC's Fall 2025 batch!

How does this work from a technical standpoint? Do you have to implement a full HTML&#x2F;CSS renderer in JS, or is there an official browser API to capture the elements as image data? reply jmm77 11 minutes ago | parent | next [–] I&#x27;m using several functions to clone the DOM and insert it into an SVG &lt;foreignObject&gt;. This approach is now well supported across modern browsers, although &lt;foreignObject&gt; is still a rather primitive way to handle HTML and styles within SVG, which can sometimes lead to results that aren&#x27;t fully precise in certain cases. To reduce the size, I created internal CSS classes to avoid repeating CSS properties, and I&#x27;m also using several caches to prevent re-cloning styles that have already been processed. There&#x27;s still a long journey ahead, but I hope a plugin system will allow for more fine-grained control over all capture stages reply XCSme 14 minutes ago | prev | next [–] Congrats! If a render is 13ms (under 16ms), it means it could, in theory, also record page video capture at 60fps or 30fps? reply jmm77 7 minutes ago | parent | next [–] Yes, I&#x27;m afraid it depends a lot on what elements you are capturing. But maybe with a plugin designed to perform a capture burst and collect them in an array, it would be possible to generate an animation as output. reply allan_s 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] For the 1st example, snapdom is not only faster, but actually correct, while html2canvas has some artifacts (on Linux&#x2F;Firefox) reply jmm77 37 minutes ago | parent | next [–] Thank you for mentionig this. There are still some caveats I hope fix soon. And I working on a plugin system to allow user modify all aspects of the capture reply kreetx 58 minutes ago | prev | next [–] SnapDOM can capture HTML elements as SVG - what are use cases for this? reply JimDabell 17 minutes ago | parent | next [–] It seems like it would be a lot more efficient to use SVG for screenshot testing design system components rather than raster images. reply jmm77 39 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] Yes, the default capture output is a svg dataurl. But there many other export options. This lib was made as an internal tool for another project called Zumly that is zoomable engine and the svg format was the faster output I found. But then I realized that could be an independent tool like html2canvas reply ajyotirmay 1 hour ago | prev [–] Good job!

Some of these companies, I only know by name. And if I&#x27;m stuck between two unknown companies, I&#x27;ll go with the one that I&#x27;ve seen the most. Not really prestige, but because their branding &#x2F; exposure &#x2F; whatever. reply WhyIsItAlwaysHN 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] You might want to add a simple description of each company. I don&#x27;t know half of them and in this dopamine shot optimized format, I don&#x27;t really have the patience to research every one of them in a different tab. reply noelwelsh 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] Weird that the reasons don&#x27;t include anything about the actual work. The work I envisage doing is a much more important reason than, say, prestige to me. reply jakewins 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] Primary reason for my choices was I didn’t want the other company. Do I want to work for Instacart? Not really. Do I prefer working for Instacart over Tesla? Well, I’d rather go back to hand digging trenches in the rain than work for Tesla, so yeah I prefer Instacart. reply neilv 11 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Same here. The first ~10 companies I saw were a dumpster fire. I think that US companies in general are better on average than this. reply bayindirh 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yeah, same for me. Choosing the less bad one. reply tdeck 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] Ethics is also a big one for me but seems to be missing. reply furk 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] It also mentions “remote” as a reason as if I know which companies allow remote work by heart. reply scarface_74 15 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] I mean for either company you are going to be helping a company to chase profits. There is nothing wrong with that. But let’s not pretend there is a deeper meaning to work than to exchange labor for money. None of these companies will see you as any more than a number. The only deciding factor would be remote work and money. reply noelwelsh 0 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] This is the weird Homo economicus take that pops quite often on HN. It shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that some people want more than just money from the place where they spend half or more of their waking life. You can just check the comments here to see some of the reasons that people work, beyond money. reply poisonborz 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] Would need an option &quot;to not join the other&quot; when asking why. reply probably_wrong 1 hour ago | parent | next [–] I&#x27;d also like an option for &quot;I&#x27;d rather be unemployed&quot;. reply globular-toast 56 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] Yep. Every time a &quot;trading&quot; company came up like Jane Street my only option was to select the other. reply nottorp 20 minutes ago | prev | next [–] &quot;Which company would you prefer to join if you had extensive info about all those companies&quot; would be a more appropriate title. I clicked hoping it&#x27;s some sort of quiz about what i prefer to work on and how work is done, that will eventually recommend me a few companies. reply Mashimo 35 minutes ago | prev | next [–] Hard to say when I don&#x27;t know the details. I prefer Work Life Balance and the people, but how would I know if MongoDB .. or whoever, is a fit? reply simoncion 6 minutes ago | prev | next [–] So... it&#x27;s Hot or Not, but with a two-point scale and for companies, rather than people? reply INTPenis 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] The list is actually missing the only two companies I ever dreamed of joining.

It&#x27;s an under-told tale that open CPU&#x27;s are &quot;easy&quot; to make, but if you actually want to actually run that chip it&#x27;s everything else that makes it inordinately hard. Probably like 99.9% of devices with USB hosts all use the same 4-5 different design families of host controllers. A huge number of sound chips are Cadence&#x2F;Tensilica&#x27;s HiFi 4&#x2F;5 chip. Dram controllers, PCIe blocks... There&#x27;s so many modular blocks used in making chips, where a pre-qualified design that already has been validated on a variety of fabs is just how everyone does it. This is a 5 year old, barely updated project. There&#x27;s no clear data on what was achieved that I can see here. But just getting a start doing chip design that interfaces with the world beyond the chip is a huge huge step forward. Building, characterizing what we get, tweaking &amp; trying over again is what it&#x27;s gonna take to make open source chips emerge &amp; be able to stand on their own. reply gchadwick 58 minutes ago | prev | next [–] I wonder if they ever taped this out and did some device characterization? The devil really is in the details with things like this. 1 in 10 million events which may be hard to trigger in a detailed analogue simulation can occur many times per second when you run it in silicon and make it effectively useless. Still very cool to have enough open source tooling and a PDK so this can even be attempted as a piece of open source design work! reply peter_d_sherman 6 hours ago | prev [–] Related (book): &quot;High-Speed Serial I&#x2F;O Made Simple: A Designers’ Guide, with FPGA Applications&quot; (2005): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xilinx.com&#x2F;publications&#x2F;archives&#x2F;books&#x2F;serialio.... reply Consider applying for YC's Fall 2025 batch!

important functional block used in high speed communication. SerDes converts parallel data into a serial (one bit) stream of data that is transmitted over a high-speed connection, such as LVDS, to a receiver that converts the serial stream back to the original, parallel data. A global CLOCK signal is present to sequence the serialization and deserialization of data from one block to another. Technology: Skywater OpenPDK 130nm Tools Used: OpenLane, Virtuoso Cadence The Serializer and Deserializer blocks are coded in Verilog HDL and synthesized using Openlane tool mapped to Sky130 CMOS technology. Simulation results and associated gds, spice and netlist files are uploaded in Serializer and Deserializer folders respectively A chain of CMOS inverters is used as TX driver to drive the input capacitance of the channel. The gds, spice, netlist and. oa files for the same are present in Inverter_Based_Tx folder A fully synthesizable Rx is designed using Resistive FB inverter followed by CMOS inverter as sensing and gain element respectively. The following DFF is used to sample the data using the clock recovered by the CDR. Resistive Feedback inverter is used as sensing element to sense low amplitude received signal at the front end of the receiver. Details of the implementation of Resistive FB inverter can be found in Resistive_FB_inverter folder DFF is the simplest memory block to sample and store the data before deserializing. Master Slave DFF is implemented using NAND logic gates. Details of the same are present in DFF and NAND folders Oversampling CDR is used to recover the data and clock from the received signal. The CDR uses the data transitions to tune the clock frequency for proper decoding of received signal. The Oversampling_CDR folder contains the gds, spice and synthesized Verilog files generated from Openlane tool.

They use: &quot;systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks&quot;. I also like the way they distinguish between &quot;agents&quot; and &quot;workflows&quot;, and describe a bunch of useful workflow patterns. I published some notes on that article when it first came out: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simonwillison.net&#x2F;2024&#x2F;Dec&#x2F;20&#x2F;building-effective-age... A more recent article from Anthropic is https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anthropic.com&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;built-multi-agent-rese... - &quot;How we built our multi-agent research system&quot;. I found this one fascinating, I wrote up a bunch of notes on it here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simonwillison.net&#x2F;2025&#x2F;Jun&#x2F;14&#x2F;multi-agent-research-s... reply swyx 10 hours ago | parent | next [–] one half of the authors of Building Effective Agents also came by AIE to do a well received talk version of this article: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=D7_ipDqhtwk reply smoyer 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The article on the multi-agent research is awesome. I do disagree with one statement in the building effective AI agents article - building your initial system without a framework sounds nice as an educational endeavor but the first benefit you get from a good framework is the easy ability to try out different (and cross-vendor) LLMs reply XenophileJKO 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Having built several systems serving massive user bases with LLMs. I think the ability to swap out APIs just isn&#x27;t the bottleneck.. like ever. It is always the behavioral issues or capability differences between models. The frameworks just usually add more complexity, obscurity, and API misalignment. Now the equation can change IF you are getting a lot of observability, experimentation, etc. I think we are just reaching that point of utility where it is a real question whether you should use the framework by default. For example I build a first version of a product with my own java code hooking right into an API. I was able to deliver the product quickly with a clean architecture and observability, etc. Then once the internal ecosystem was aligned on a framework (on mentioned in the article) a team took up migrating it to python on the framework. It still isn&#x27;t complete, it just introduces a lot of abstraction layers where you have to adapt them to your internal systems and your internal observability setup, and any other things that the rest of your applications do. People underestimate that cost. So by default to get your V0 product off the ground (if you are not a complete startup), just use the API. That is my advice. reply davedx 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] This aligns with my experience (specifically with langgraph). I actually find it a depressing sign of the times that your prototype was in Java and the &quot;production&quot; version is going to be in python. My experience with langgraph is you spend so much time just fixing stupid runtime type errors because the state of every graph is a stupid JSON blob with very minimal typing, and it&#x27;s so hard figuring out how data moves through the system. Combined with python&#x27;s already weak type support, and the fact you&#x27;re usually dealing with long running processes where things break mid- or end- of process, development becomes quite awful. AI coding assistants only help so much. Tests are hard to write because these frameworks inevitably lean in to the dynamic nature of python. I just can&#x27;t understand why people are choosing to build these huge complex systems in an untyped language when the only AI or ML is API calls... or very occasionally doing some lightweight embeddings. reply miki123211 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This is why you use a library (not a framework) that provides an abstraction over different LLMs. I&#x27;m personally a fan of litellm, but I&#x27;m sure alternatives exist. reply kodablah 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I believe the definition of workflows in this article is inaccurate. Workflows in modern engines do not take predefined code paths, and agents are effectively the same as workflows in these cases. The redefinition of workflows seems to be an attempt to differentiate, but for the most part an agent is nothing more than a workflow that is a loop that dynamically invokes things based on LLM responses. Modern workflow engines are very dynamic. reply sothatsit 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I think the distinction is more about the &quot;level of railroading&quot;. Workflows have a lot more structure and rules about information and control flow. Agents, on the other hand, are often given a set of tools and a prompt. They are much more free-form. For example, a workflow might define a fuzzy rule like &quot;if customer issue is refund, go to refund flow,&quot; while an agent gets customer service tools and figures out how to handle each case on its own. To me, this is a meaningful distinction to make. Workflows can be more predictable and reliable. Agents have more freedom and can tackle a greater breadth of tasks. reply simonw 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You appear to be making the mistake of assuming that the only valid definition for the term &quot;workflow&quot; is the definition used by software such as https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airflow.apache.org&#x2F; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;workflow thinks the word dates back to 1921. There no reason Anthropic can&#x27;t take that word and present their own alternative definition for it in the context of LLM tool usage, which is what they&#x27;ve done here. reply koakuma-chan 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Does anyone know which AI agent framework Anthropic uses? It doesn&#x27;t seem like they ever released one of their own. reply ankit219 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] From what it looks like, it&#x27;s one main LLM (you are sending query to - orchestrator) which calls other LLMs via tool calls. The tools are capable of calling llms too, and can have specific instructions, but mostly just the orchestrator deciding what they should be researching on, and assigns them specific subqueries. There is a limited depth &#x2F; levels of search queries too, you should see the prompt they use[1] One cool example of this in action is seen when you use claude code and ask it to search something. In a verbose setting, it calls an MCP tool to help with search. The tool returns summary of the results with the relevant links (not the raw search result text). A similar method, albeit more robust, is used when Claude is doing deep research as well. [1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anthropics&#x2F;anthropic-cookbook&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;p... reply rockwotj 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Just write the for loop to react to tool calls? It’s not very much code. reply koakuma-chan 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] They mentioned hand offs, sub agents, concurrent tool calls, etc. You could write that yourself, but you would be inventing your own framework. reply crazylogger 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Sub-agent is another LLM loop that you simply import and provide as a tool to your orchestrator LLM. For example in Claude Code, sub-agent is a tool called &quot;Task(&lt;description&gt;)&quot; made available to the main LLM (the one that you chat with) along with other tools like patch_file and web_search. Concurrent tool call is when LLM writes multiple tool calls instead of one, and you can program your app to execute those sequentially or concurrently. This is a trivial concept. The &quot;agent framework&quot; layer here is so thin it might as well don&#x27;t exist, and you can use Anthropic&#x2F;OAI&#x27;s sdk directly. I don&#x27;t see a need for fancy graphs with circles here. reply risyachka 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Its still just a loop. Also - funny enough how “parallel calls” became a feature in AI? Like wow, yeah, we could call functions in parallel since the dawn of CS reply juddlyon 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Thank you for the extra notes, this is top of mind for me. reply suninsight 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] As someone who works for a company having a real Agent in production, (not a workflow), I cannot disagree more than the very first statement here: Use Agent Frameworks like Langraph. We did exactly that, and had to throw everything away just a month down the line. Then we built everything from scratch and now our system scales pretty well. To be fair, I think there might be a space for using Agent Frameworks, but the Agent space is too early for a good enough framework to emerge. The semi contrarian though, which I hold to a certain extent, is that the Agent space is moving so fast that a good enough framework might NEVER emerge. reply barrenko 1 hour ago | parent | next [–] The event horizon of current AI space has been quite a thing to observe. reply chaosprint 12 hours ago | prev | next [–] Half a year has passed, and it feels like a long time in the field of AI. I read this article repeatedly a few months ago, but now I think the development of Agent has obviously reached a bottleneck. Even the latest gemini seems to have regressed. reply jsemrau 12 hours ago | parent | next [–] (1) Running multiple agents is expensive, decreasing RoI. My DeepSearch agent for stocks uses 6 agents, and each query costs about 2 USD. (2) Multi-agent orchestration is difficult to control. (3) The more capable the model, the lower the need for multi-agents. (4) The less capable the model, the higher the business case for narrow AI. reply EGreg 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] What exactly makes them regress? Why can’t they just fork swarms of themselves, work 24&#x2F;7 in parallel, check work and keep advancing? reply amelius 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Because they are not intelligent. (And this is a good definition of it). reply m3kw9 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] They have hard time solving prompt issues injection and that’s a one of the bottle necks reply laurentiurad 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] I used an n8n workflow I developed with one of the exact setups shown in the article. It costs me $3 and at least 3 minutes to get a response to a simple question. No thanks, I am sticking to normal search for the moment. reply Zaylan 7 hours ago | prev | next [–] This article is a good reminder to start with the simplest thing that works and only add complexity when it&#x27;s truly needed. A few clearly defined LLM calls with some light glue logic usually lead to something more stable, easier to debug, and much cheaper to run. The flashy, full-featured agents often end up causing more problems than they solve. reply spenczar5 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] (December 2024, which somehow feels an eternity ago) reply nahsra 14 hours ago | parent | next [–] Yes, but it&#x27;s held up really well in my opinion! I use this piece constantly as a reference and I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s aged. It reframed Anthropic as &quot;the practical partner&quot; in the development of AI tools. reply nico 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; Nooooo I&#x27;m going to have to use my brain again and write 100% of my code like a caveman from December 2024 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44260988 reply bredren 11 hours ago | prev | next [–] It’s helpful but I think Anthropic should be offering non technical versions of this. For example, a marketing group is interested in agents but needs a guide on how to spec them at a basic level. There is a figure toward the end and an appendix that starts to drive at this. Even though it’s new, “how to build them” is an implementation concern. reply AvAn12 14 hours ago | prev | next [–] How do agents deal with task queueing, race conditions, and other issues arising from concurrency? I see lots of cool articles about building workflows of multiple agents - plus what feels like hand-waving around declaring an orchestrator agent to oversee the whole thing. And my mind goes to whether there needs to be some serious design considerations and clever glue code. Or does it all work automagically? reply simonw 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] The standard for &quot;agents&quot; is that tools run in sequence, so no need to worry about concurrency. Several models support parallel tool calls now where the model can say &quot;Run these three tools&quot; and your harness can chose to run them in parallel or sequentially before passing the results back to the model as the next step in the conversation. Anthropic are leaning more into multi-agent setups where the parent agent might delegate to one or more sub-agents which might run in parallel. They use that trick for Claude Code - I have some notes on reverse-engineering that here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simonwillison.net&#x2F;2025&#x2F;Jun&#x2F;2&#x2F;claude-trace&#x2F; - and expand on that in their write-up of how Claude Research works: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simonwillison.net&#x2F;2025&#x2F;Jun&#x2F;14&#x2F;multi-agent-research-s... It&#x27;s still _very_ early in figuring out good patterns for LLM tool-use - the models only got really great at using tools in about the past 6 months, so there&#x27;s plenty to be discovered about how best to orchestrate them. reply svachalek 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re at &quot;great&quot; yet. Gemini 2.5 pro fails maybe 50% of the time for me at even generating a syntactically successful tool call. reply simonw 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Are you using Gemini&#x27;s baked in API tool calling mechanisms or are you prompting it and telling it to produce specific XML&#x2F;JSON? reply mediaman 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] What do you recommend for this? I&#x27;ve actually had good luck having them create XML, even though you&#x27;re &quot;supposed&quot; to use the native tool calling in a JSON schema.

You still have to build in all the operational characteristics that you would for any traditional system. It&#x27;s deceptively easy to look at some AI agent demos and think &quot;oh, I can replace my team&#x27;s huge mess of spaghetti code with a few clever AI prompts!&quot; And it may even work for the first couple use cases. But all that code is there for a reason, and eventually it&#x27;ll have to be reckoned with. Once you get to the point where you&#x27;re translating all that code directly into the AI prompt and hoping for no hallucinations, you know you&#x27;ve lost the plot. reply whattheheckheck 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Then wtf is the point of this? reply rdedev 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This is why I am leaning towards making the llm generate code that calls operates on took calls instead of having everything in JSON. Huggingfaces&#x27;s smolagents library makes the llm generate python code where tools are just normal python functions. If you want parallel tools calls just prompt the llm to do so. It should take care of synchronizing everything. Ofcourse there is the whole issue around executing llm generated code but we have a few solutions for that reply 0x457 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I can only talk about Codex web interface, I had a very detailed refactoring plan for a project it was too long to complete in one go, so used &quot;ask&quot; feature to split it up into multiple task and group them by &quot;which tasks can be executed concurrently&quot;. It split them up in a way they would be split up in real life, but in real life there is an assumption that people working on tasks going to communicate with each other. The way it generates tasks resulted in HUGE loss of context (my plan was hella detailed). I was willing to spend a few more hours trying to make it work rather than doing the work myself. I&#x27;ve opened another chat and split it up into multiple sequential tasks, with a detailed prompt for each task (why, what, how, validation, update documentation reminder etc). Anyway, orchestrator might work on some super simple tasks, much smaller tasks than those articles make you believe. reply cmsparks 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Frankly, it&#x27;s pretty difficult. Though, I&#x27;ve found that the actor model maps really well onto building agents. An instance of an actor = an instance of an agent. Agent to agent communication is just tool calling (via MCP or some other RPC) I use Cloudflare&#x27;s Durable Objects (disclaimer: I&#x27;m biased, I work on MCP + Agent things @ Cloudflare). However, I figure building agents probably maps similarly well onto any actor style framework. reply pyman 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Should the people developing AI agent protocols be exploring decentralised architectures, using technologies like blockchain and peer-to-peer networks to distribute models and data? What are the trade-offs of relying on centralised orchestration platforms owned by large companies like Amazon, Cloudfare or NVIDIA? Thanks reply daxfohl 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That&#x27;s more of a hobbyist thing I&#x27;d say. Corporations developing these things will of course want to use some centralized system that they trust. It&#x27;s more efficient, they have more control over it, it&#x27;s easier for average people to use, etc. A decentralized thing would be more for individuals who want more control and transparency. A decentralized public ledger would make it possible to verify that your agent, the agents it interacts with, and the contents of their interactions have not been altered or compromised in any way, whereas a corporate-owned framework could not provide the same level of assurance. But technically, there&#x27;s no advantage I can think of for using a public distributed ledger to manage interactions. Agent tasks are pretty ephemeral, so unlike digital currency, there&#x27;s not really a need to maintain a complete historical log of every action forever. And as far as providing tools for dealing with race conditions, blockchain would be about the least efficient way of creating a mutex imaginable. So technically, just like with non-AI apps, cetralized architecture is always going to be a lot more efficient. reply pyman 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Good points. I agree that for most companies using centralised systems offers more advantages because of efficiency, control and user experience, but I wasn&#x27;t arguing that decentralisation is better technically, just wondering if it might be necessary in the long run. If agents become more autonomous and start coordinating across platforms owned by different companies, it might make sense to have some kind of shared, trustless layer (maybe not blockchain but something distributed, auditable and neutral). I agree that agent tasks are ephemeral, but what about long lived multi-agent workflows or contracts between agents that execute over time? In those cases transparency and integrity might matter more. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s one or the other. Centralised systems will dominate in the short term, no doubt about that, but if we&#x27;re serious about agent ecosystems at scale, we might need more open coordination models too. reply gk1 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] In at least the case for coding agents the emerging pattern is to have the agents use containers for isolating work and git for reviewing and merging that work neatly. See for example the container use MCP which combines both: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dagger&#x2F;container-use That’s for parallelizing coding work… I’m not sure about other kinds of work.

Barry and Erik spend 80% of the post saying ~”eh, you probably don’t need agents. Just build straightforward deterministic workflows with if-statements instead.” And then, when you actually do need agents, don’t over complicate it! This post also introduced the concept of an Augmented LLM — a LLM hooked up to tools, memory, data — which is a useful abstraction for evolving LLM use beyond fancy autocomplete. “An augmented LLM running in a loop” is the best definition of an agent I’ve heard so far. reply iLoveOncall 13 hours ago | prev | next [–] &gt; These frameworks make it easy to get started by simplifying standard low-level tasks like calling LLMs, defining and parsing tools, and chaining calls together.

It&#x27;s insane that people use whole frameworks to send what is essentially an array of strings to a webservice.

Tomorrow, for any truly autonomous, long-lived agent, it will be about a continuous &quot;existence tax&quot; levied by the platform owner. The orchestrator isn&#x27;t just a technical component; it&#x27;s a landlord. The alternative isn&#x27;t a more complex framework. It&#x27;s a permissionless execution layer—a digital wilderness where an agent&#x27;s survival depends on its own resources, not a platform&#x27;s benevolence.

Consistently, the most successful implementations use simple, composable patterns rather than complex frameworks. Over the past year, we&#x27;ve worked with dozens of teams building large language model (LLM) agents across industries. Consistently, the most successful implementations weren&#x27;t using complex frameworks or specialized libraries. Instead, they were building with simple, composable patterns. In this post, we share what we’ve learned from working with our customers and building agents ourselves, and give practical advice for developers on building effective agents. What are agents? &quot;Agent&quot; can be defined in several ways. Some customers define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools to accomplish complex tasks. Others use the term to describe more prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows. At Anthropic, we categorize all these variations as agentic systems , but draw an important architectural distinction between workflows and agents : Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths. Agents , on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks. Below, we will explore both types of agentic systems in detail. In Appendix 1 (“Agents in Practice”), we describe two domains where customers have found particular value in using these kinds of systems. When (and when not) to use agents When building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest solution possible, and only increasing complexity when needed. This might mean not building agentic systems at all. Agentic systems often trade latency and cost for better task performance, and you should consider when this tradeoff makes sense. When more complexity is warranted, workflows offer predictability and consistency for well-defined tasks, whereas agents are the better option when flexibility and model-driven decision-making are needed at scale. For many applications, however, optimizing single LLM calls with retrieval and in-context examples is usually enough. When and how to use frameworks There are many frameworks that make agentic systems easier to implement, including: LangGraph from LangChain; Amazon Bedrock&#x27;s AI Agent framework ; Rivet , a drag and drop GUI LLM workflow builder; and Vellum , another GUI tool for building and testing complex workflows. These frameworks make it easy to get started by simplifying standard low-level tasks like calling LLMs, defining and parsing tools, and chaining calls together. However, they often create extra layers of abstraction that can obscure the underlying prompts ​​and responses, making them harder to debug. They can also make it tempting to add complexity when a simpler setup would suffice. We suggest that developers start by using LLM APIs directly: many patterns can be implemented in a few lines of code. If you do use a framework, ensure you understand the underlying code. Incorrect assumptions about what&#x27;s under the hood are a common source of customer error. See our cookbook for some sample implementations. Building blocks, workflows, and agents In this section, we’ll explore the common patterns for agentic systems we’ve seen in production. We&#x27;ll start with our foundational building block—the augmented LLM—and progressively increase complexity, from simple compositional workflows to autonomous agents. Building block: The augmented LLM The basic building block of agentic systems is an LLM enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory. Our current models can actively use these capabilities—generating their own search queries, selecting appropriate tools, and determining what information to retain. The augmented LLM We recommend focusing on two key aspects of the implementation: tailoring these capabilities to your specific use case and ensuring they provide an easy, well-documented interface for your LLM. While there are many ways to implement these augmentations, one approach is through our recently released Model Context Protocol , which allows developers to integrate with a growing ecosystem of third-party tools with a simple client implementation . For the remainder of this post, we&#x27;ll assume each LLM call has access to these augmented capabilities. Workflow: Prompt chaining Prompt chaining decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. You can add programmatic checks (see &quot;gate” in the diagram below) on any intermediate steps to ensure that the process is still on track. The prompt chaining workflow When to use this workflow: This workflow is ideal for situations where the task can be easily and cleanly decomposed into fixed subtasks. The main goal is to trade off latency for higher accuracy, by making each LLM call an easier task. Examples where prompt chaining is useful: Generating Marketing copy, then translating it into a different language. Writing an outline of a document, checking that the outline meets certain criteria, then writing the document based on the outline. Workflow: Routing Routing classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup task. This workflow allows for separation of concerns, and building more specialized prompts. Without this workflow, optimizing for one kind of input can hurt performance on other inputs. The routing workflow When to use this workflow: Routing works well for complex tasks where there are distinct categories that are better handled separately, and where classification can be handled accurately, either by an LLM or a more traditional classification model/algorithm. Examples where routing is useful: Directing different types of customer service queries (general questions, refund requests, technical support) into different downstream processes, prompts, and tools. Routing easy/common questions to smaller models like Claude 3.5 Haiku and hard/unusual questions to more capable models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet to optimize cost and speed. Workflow: Parallelization LLMs can sometimes work simultaneously on a task and have their outputs aggregated programmatically. This workflow, parallelization, manifests in two key variations: Sectioning : Breaking a task into independent subtasks run in parallel. Voting: Running the same task multiple times to get diverse outputs. The parallelization workflow When to use this workflow: Parallelization is effective when the divided subtasks can be parallelized for speed, or when multiple perspectives or attempts are needed for higher confidence results. For complex tasks with multiple considerations, LLMs generally perform better when each consideration is handled by a separate LLM call, allowing focused attention on each specific aspect. Examples where parallelization is useful: Sectioning : Implementing guardrails where one model instance processes user queries while another screens them for inappropriate content or requests. This tends to perform better than having the same LLM call handle both guardrails and the core response. Automating evals for evaluating LLM performance, where each LLM call evaluates a different aspect of the model’s performance on a given prompt. Voting : Reviewing a piece of code for vulnerabilities, where several different prompts review and flag the code if they find a problem. Evaluating whether a given piece of content is inappropriate, with multiple prompts evaluating different aspects or requiring different vote thresholds to balance false positives and negatives. Workflow: Orchestrator-workers In the orchestrator-workers workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results. The orchestrator-workers workflow When to use this workflow: This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can’t predict the subtasks needed (in coding, for example, the number of files that need to be changed and the nature of the change in each file likely depend on the task). Whereas it’s topographically similar, the key difference from parallelization is its flexibility—subtasks aren&#x27;t pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input. Example where orchestrator-workers is useful: Coding products that make complex changes to multiple files each time. Search tasks that involve gathering and analyzing information from multiple sources for possible relevant information. Workflow: Evaluator-optimizer In the evaluator-optimizer workflow, one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop. The evaluator-optimizer workflow When to use this workflow: This workflow is particularly effective when we have clear evaluation criteria, and when iterative refinement provides measurable value. The two signs of good fit are, first, that LLM responses can be demonstrably improved when a human articulates their feedback; and second, that the LLM can provide such feedback. This is analogous to the iterative writing process a human writer might go through when producing a polished document. Examples where evaluator-optimizer is useful: Literary translation where there are nuances that the translator LLM might not capture initially, but where an evaluator LLM can provide useful critiques. Complex search tasks that require multiple rounds of searching and analysis to gather comprehensive information, where the evaluator decides whether further searches are warranted. Agents Agents are emerging in production as LLMs mature in key capabilities—understanding complex inputs, engaging in reasoning and planning, using tools reliably, and recovering from errors. Agents begin their work with either a command from, or interactive discussion with, the human user. Once the task is clear, agents plan and operate independently, potentially returning to the human for further information or judgement. During execution, it&#x27;s crucial for the agents to gain “ground truth” from the environment at each step (such as tool call results or code execution) to assess its progress. Agents can then pause for human feedback at checkpoints or when encountering blockers. The task often terminates upon completion, but it’s also common to include stopping conditions (such as a maximum number of iterations) to maintain control. Agents can handle sophisticated tasks, but their implementation is often straightforward. They are typically just LLMs using tools based on environmental feedback in a loop. It is therefore crucial to design toolsets and their documentation clearly and thoughtfully. We expand on best practices for tool development in Appendix 2 (&quot;Prompt Engineering your Tools&quot;). Autonomous agent When to use agents: Agents can be used for open-ended problems where it’s difficult or impossible to predict the required number of steps, and where you can’t hardcode a fixed path. The LLM will potentially operate for many turns, and you must have some level of trust in its decision-making. Agents&#x27; autonomy makes them ideal for scaling tasks in trusted environments. The autonomous nature of agents means higher costs, and the potential for compounding errors. We recommend extensive testing in sandboxed environments, along with the appropriate guardrails. Examples where agents are useful: The following examples are from our own implementations: A coding Agent to resolve SWE-bench tasks , which involve edits to many files based on a task description; Our “computer use” reference implementation , where Claude uses a computer to accomplish tasks. High-level flow of a coding agent Combining and customizing these patterns These building blocks aren&#x27;t prescriptive. They&#x27;re common patterns that developers can shape and combine to fit different use cases. The key to success, as with any LLM features, is measuring performance and iterating on implementations. To repeat: you should consider adding complexity only when it demonstrably improves outcomes. Summary Success in the LLM space isn&#x27;t about building the most sophisticated system. It&#x27;s about building the right system for your needs. Start with simple prompts, optimize them with comprehensive evaluation, and add multi-step agentic systems only when simpler solutions fall short. When implementing agents, we try to follow three core principles: Maintain simplicity in your agent&#x27;s design. Prioritize transparency by explicitly showing the agent’s planning steps. Carefully craft your agent-computer interface (ACI) through thorough tool documentation and testing . Frameworks can help you get started quickly, but don&#x27;t hesitate to reduce abstraction layers and build with basic components as you move to production. By following these principles, you can create agents that are not only powerful but also reliable, maintainable, and trusted by their users. Acknowledgements Written by Erik Schluntz and Barry Zhang. This work draws upon our experiences building agents at Anthropic and the valuable insights shared by our customers, for which we&#x27;re deeply grateful. Appendix 1: Agents in practice Our work with customers has revealed two particularly promising applications for AI agents that demonstrate the practical value of the patterns discussed above. Both applications illustrate how agents add the most value for tasks that require both conversation and action, have clear success criteria, enable feedback loops, and integrate meaningful human oversight. A. Customer support Customer support combines familiar chatbot interfaces with enhanced capabilities through tool integration. This is a natural fit for more open-ended agents because: Support interactions naturally follow a conversation flow while requiring access to external information and actions; Tools can be integrated to pull customer data, order history, and knowledge base articles; Actions such as issuing refunds or updating tickets can be handled programmatically; and Success can be clearly measured through user-defined resolutions. Several companies have demonstrated the viability of this approach through usage-based pricing models that charge only for successful resolutions, showing confidence in their agents&#x27; effectiveness. B. Coding agents The software development space has shown remarkable potential for LLM features, with capabilities evolving from code completion to autonomous problem-solving. Agents are particularly effective because: Code solutions are verifiable through automated tests; Agents can iterate on solutions using test results as feedback; The problem space is well-defined and structured; and Output quality can be measured objectively. In our own implementation, agents can now solve real GitHub issues in the SWE-bench Verified benchmark based on the pull request description alone. However, whereas automated testing helps verify functionality, human review remains crucial for ensuring solutions align with broader system requirements. Appendix 2: Prompt engineering your tools No matter which agentic system you&#x27;re building, tools will likely be an important part of your agent. Tools enable Claude to interact with external services and APIs by specifying their exact structure and definition in our API. When Claude responds, it will include a tool use block in the API response if it plans to invoke a tool. Tool definitions and specifications should be given just as much prompt engineering attention as your overall prompts. In this brief appendix, we describe how to prompt engineer your tools. There are often several ways to specify the same action. For instance, you can specify a file edit by writing a diff, or by rewriting the entire file. For structured output, you can return code inside markdown or inside JSON. In software engineering, differences like these are cosmetic and can be converted losslessly from one to the other. However, some formats are much more difficult for an LLM to write than others. Writing a diff requires knowing how many lines are changing in the chunk header before the new code is written. Writing code inside JSON (compared to markdown) requires extra escaping of newlines and quotes. Our suggestions for deciding on tool formats are the following: Give the model enough tokens to &quot;think&quot; before it writes itself into a corner. Keep the format close to what the model has seen naturally occurring in text on the internet. Make sure there&#x27;s no formatting &quot;overhead&quot; such as having to keep an accurate count of thousands of lines of code, or string-escaping any code it writes. One rule of thumb is to think about how much effort goes into human-computer interfaces (HCI), and plan to invest just as much effort in creating good agent -computer interfaces (ACI). Here are some thoughts on how to do so: Put yourself in the model&#x27;s shoes. Is it obvious how to use this tool, based on the description and parameters, or would you need to think carefully about it? If so, then it’s probably also true for the model. A good tool definition often includes example usage, edge cases, input format requirements, and clear boundaries from other tools. How can you change parameter names or descriptions to make things more obvious? Think of this as writing a great docstring for a junior developer on your team. This is especially important when using many similar tools. Test how the model uses your tools: Run many example inputs in our workbench to see what mistakes the model makes, and iterate. Poka-yoke your tools. Change the arguments so that it is harder to make mistakes. While building our agent for SWE-bench , we actually spent more time optimizing our tools than the overall prompt. For example, we found that the model would make mistakes with tools using relative filepaths after the agent had moved out of the root directory. To fix this, we changed the tool to always require absolute filepaths—and we found that the model used this method flawlessly.

I prefer to test as much of the stack as possible. The most common mistake I see these days is people testing too much in isolation, which leads to a false sense of safety. If you care about being alerted when your dependencies break, writing only the kind of tests described in the article is risky. You’ve removed those dependencies from your test suite. If a minor library update changes `.json()` to `.parse(format=&quot;json&quot;)`, and you assumed they followed semver but they didn’t: you’ll find out after deployment. Ah, but you use static typing? Great! That’ll catch some API changes. But if you discover an API changed without warning (because you thought nobody would ever do that) you’re on your own again. I suggest using a nice HTTP recording&#x2F;replay library for your tests so you can adapt easily (without making live HTTP calls in your tests, which would be way too flaky, even if feasible). I stopped worrying long ago about what is or isn’t “real” unit testing. I test as much of the software stack as I can. If a test covers too many abstraction layers at once, I split it into lower- and higher-level cases. These days, I prefer fewer “poorly” factored tests that cover many real layers of the code over countless razor-thin unit tests that only check whether a loop was implemented correctly. While risking that the whole system doesn’t work together. Because by the time you get to write your system&#x2F;integration&#x2F;whatever tests, you’re already exhausted from writing and refactoring all those near-pointless micro-tests. reply hynek 6 minutes ago | parent | next [–] &gt; I’m not sure this is good advice.

Consider a load shedder, a parser, or an implementation of an algorithm. Most devs will naturally write a unit test for anything with complicated logic just because it&#x27;s easier to test complicated things in isolation. reply eximius 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] And better yet, follow the tangential advice and use high fidelity fakes (I usually don&#x27;t quite go all the way to verified fakes&#x2F;contract tests, but they&#x27;re a good idea if you have the time). Real object where practical, fakes otherwise, mocks only as required for exceptional circumstances. Works great in interconnected monorepos where you can provide high fidelity fakes of your services for other integrating teams to use in their tests. Often our service fakes are literally just the real service wrapped with an injected fake DB&#x2F;store. reply sparsely 50 minutes ago | parent | next [–] Fakes are better than mocks if only for the 100x superior debugging experience. reply AugustoCAS 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] Something that I find amusing in the Java community is that a good number of senior developers, with anything from 5-20 years of experience, who do &#x27;tdd&#x27; have never heard of the concept of test doubles and religiously think that a class must be tested in complete isolation mocking everything else. The saddest one I saw was a team trying to do functional programming (with Spring). The tech lead was a bit flummoxed when I asked why mocks are not used in functional languages and continued to think that &#x27;mocking functions&#x27; is the correct way to do TDD. reply esailija 1 hour ago | parent | next [–] Tests knowing about implementation details and testing the implementation details (which is the case 99.999% of the time if you use mocks) is more common than not. Even when the main value of automated testing is being able to change those very implementation details, that you now cannot do. A whole bunch of work spent for no benefit or negative benefit is pretty common. reply lmm 40 minutes ago | prev | next [–] Ok but the test is now not covering the parts that are actually going to break. And if you&#x27;re only testing the parts above the nice business-friendly interface, you probably don&#x27;t need mocks at all. reply strken 33 minutes ago | prev | next [–] I&#x27;m confused. If I&#x27;m allowed to mock what I don&#x27;t own, but only if it has a good API that&#x27;s well-adapted to my use case, then &quot;don&#x27;t mock what you don&#x27;t own&quot; must have nothing to do with ownership. It sounds like it&#x27;s more about wrapping awkward APIs instead of calling them directly. Yes, this is good advice! But it only tangentially has anything to do with mocking. reply fellatio 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] Polite way here is similar to inversion of control. It&#x27;s a good idea but you need a real thing test somewhere but that can be running the program in its entirety, or using the facade end to end against the real interface for a spot check. reply mpweiher 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] Why I don&#x27;t mock (2014): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=7809402 &quot;Well, it&#x27;s impolite, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; reply gnabgib 3 hours ago | prev [–] (2022) reply Consider applying for YC's Fall 2025 batch!

It made me realize how little design attention we actually give to sound. Most of the time we just passively listen, without thinking about shaping the path of sound.

https://hynek.me/articles/what-to-mock-in-5-mins/|“Don’t Mock What You Don’t Own” in 5 Minutes|“Don’t Mock What You Don’t Own” in 5 Minutes Hynek Schlawack About Me Articles TIL Talks “Don’t Mock What You Don’t Own” in 5 Minutes 21 June 2022 A common issue when writing tests for real-world software is how to deal with third-party dependencies. Let&rsquo;s examine an old, but counter-intuitive principle. Once upon a time, I made a stupid joke on Twitter about the Don&rsquo;t Mock What You Don&rsquo;t Own testing principle: Only mock what you own, because mocking others is rude. — Yours Truly , Tweet While it didn&rsquo;t get me fired, it led to me being tricked into giving a 5 minute-long talk 1 about it. Given the confused replies I got to the joke Tweet, I&rsquo;ve decided it&rsquo;s worth writing down the contents of the talk for posterity. The principle Don&rsquo;t Mock What You Don&rsquo;t Own means that whenever you employ mock objects, you should use them to substitute your own objects and not third-party ones 2 . If you&rsquo;re anything like me, that makes no sense ! What else am I supposed to mock? My code is perfectly testable! Key point: there&rsquo;s a difference between owning an object and owning the API to use it. Allow me to use a simple example to demonstrate the downsides of mocking third-party objects and what to do instead. Disclaimer : I don&rsquo;t like mocks in the original sense: a test object, that mimics another (usually complex) object, records calls to its APIs , and allows you to make assertions over those calls. However, this principle is still useful, because it applies equally to any other type of test object. I will keep using the term mock throughout this article to remain congruent with the name of the principle and I will be using a popular mocking library in my examples for familiarity. However, I don&rsquo;t use mocks in my own code at all. In Python I use pretend for simple stubs and verified fakes for more complex scenarios. In Go I reach always for verified fakes . This isn&rsquo;t potayto potahto – this is a fundamental difference in how to approach testing, but it&rsquo;s out of scope for this article. If you&rsquo;re confused by the differences between mocks , fakes , stubs , et cetera , I recommend Martin Fowler&rsquo;s Mocks Aren&rsquo;t Stubs . A Docker repository client To keep my example short, I will use a Python program that uses an HTTP library, but the problem and solution are universal to any object-oriented language. If you&rsquo;ve ever run your own Docker container registry, chances are high that you&rsquo;ve written scripts around its web API . For example, you might want to print out a list of your repositories, together with a list of the tags that exist within each repository: $ list-docker-repos-with-tags web-svc 1, 5, 7 worker-svc 8, 10, 11 This is the inspiration for our example. If you don&rsquo;t know what any of this means: don&rsquo;t worry. All you need to understand is that we&rsquo;re writing a program that makes HTTP requests against a web API and extracts data from the responses. Rude mocking I&rsquo;m going to skip a bit ahead and start with an already testable-looking function. It takes an HTTP client (in this case, I use the excellent httpx package) and returns a dictionary of repository names that point to a list of the version tags. Invoking this function from a CLI and printing out its return value is not interesting for our point, so I&rsquo;m leaving it out: def get_repos_w_tags ( client ): rv = {} repos = client . get ( &#34;https://docker.example.com/v2/_catalog&#34; ) . json ()[ &#34;repositories&#34; ] for repo in repos : rv [ repo ] = client . get ( f &#34;https://docker.example.com/v2/ { repo } /tags/list&#34; ) . json ()[ &#34;tags&#34; ] return rv First we fetch a list of repository names from the _catalog endpoint, then we iterate over them and fetch the list of tags for every repository. And this is much better than a lot of code that gets written for situations like this! Many would hard-code everything and if they need to test it, they shrug their shoulders and start monkey-patching . With the code above, you can &ldquo;simply&rdquo; pass in a fake client object that returns predefined static values for calls to client.get() and look at the dictionary it returns. Look ma, no network! And yet it violates the principle that this article is about. Why? Because it&rsquo;s not simple. Let&rsquo;s have a look at the simplest possible test that checks what happens if the first client.get() call returns an empty list for the repositories key: from unittest.mock import Mock import httpx def test_empty (): client = Mock ( spec_set = httpx . Client , get = Mock ( return_value = Mock ( spec_set = httpx . Response , json = lambda : { &#34;repositories&#34; : [] }, ) ), ) assert {} == get_repos_w_tags ( client ) We need three layers of mocks to verify that an empty repositories key leads to an empty dictionary. And if I didn&rsquo;t use a lambda for the json function, it would be even four layers. I use the spec_set argument ( as should you ) to prevent unittest.mock.Mock from happily returning new mocks when you access any attribute, and yet constructs like this tend to be brittle and unpleasant to create and debug. This is a business logic test and the purpose of the test is drowning in boilerplate necessary to mimic the API of an HTTP client that can change at any time. That makes the test brittle and unidiomatic . When I read tests for business logic, I want the intent of the test to be obvious on first glimpse. You could write a helper to create mock clients that do what you want, saving you the boilerplate in individual tests. However, the more complex your tests get, and the more numerous and the more complex your involved mocks get, the less you can be sure what you&rsquo;re actually testing. Eventually, you end up in Mock Hell . In my experience, this is the wrong path, so let&rsquo;s try something different. Polite mocking All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection. — Butler Lampson , Fundamental Theorem of Software Engineering We&rsquo;ll follow Mr. Lampson&rsquo;s advice and add a very thin layer around the HTTP library, which becomes the façade between your clean code and the messy outside world. Layers like this are notoriously difficult to test 3 , so they should be kept cyclomatically as simple as possible: go easy on conditionals and loops. Otherwise you just kick the proverbial testing can one layer down and win nothing. In this case we write a DockerRegistryClient class that offers two methods whose implementations should look familiar: get_repos() that returns a list of repository names and get_repo_tags() that returns a list of tags for a repository. The code is the same as before: class DockerRegistryClient : def __init__ ( self , client ): self . _client = client def get_repos ( self ): return self . _client . get ( &#34;https://docker.example.com/v2/_catalog&#34; ) . json ()[ &#34;repositories&#34; ] def get_repo_tags ( self , repo ): return self . _client . get ( f &#34;https://docker.example.com/v2/ { repo } /tags/list&#34; ) . json ()[ &#34;tags&#34; ] I hope there&rsquo;s no surprises in this code, so let&rsquo;s apply it to our business code: def get_repos_w_tags_drc ( drc ): rv = {} for repo in drc . get_repos (): rv [ repo ] = drc . get_repo_tags ( repo ) return rv The first pay-off is that the business logic is more idiomatic! Seeing the business logic written clearly like this also reveals that it could be re-written as a dictionary comprehension! You never know beforehand what making code clearer and more idiomatic will yield you. This point can&rsquo;t be overstated : In an attempt to simplify our mocks by following a counter-intuitive principle from ancient times, we&rsquo;ve improved our business logic . Business logic is ultimately the reason you write software. It&rsquo;s the reason an application exists. Having clean and idiomatic business logic pays dividends for as long as the software exists which is always longer than you think. Let&rsquo;s rewrite the test next: def test_empty_drc (): drc = Mock ( spec_set = DockerRegistryClient , get_repos = lambda : [] ) assert {} == get_repos_w_tags_drc ( drc ) Only one Mock ! And one look and you know what&rsquo;s happening! Once you want to run more complex tests where get_repos() returns a non-empty list and you need to mock get_repo_tags() too, it&rsquo;s a lot easier because all you have to do is adding another line with get_repo_tags=lambda repo: … . No need for more nested mocks and making client.get() return different values for different calls. And if you choose to replace your HTTP library, your business tests won&rsquo;t care, because they only interface with your abstraction. Corollary : To keep your business code testable and idiomatic, avoid directly using third-party dependencies in it. When to break the rule? Every rule and principle can be broken once you&rsquo;ve fully understood its purpose. For example if an object already does have an idiomatic API, it&rsquo;s probably not worth wrapping in an identical façade, just so it belongs to you. For simple programs like in this blog post, it&rsquo;s probably easier to write a test helper that creates appropriate fake HTTP clients. Although there&rsquo;s the upside to the more idiomatic business code! At some point this becomes a trade-off against complexity and performance. Sometimes it&rsquo;s also easy enough to fake actual HTTP responses by running your own in-process HTTP server within the tests – but I prefer to isolate these kinds of tests when testing the thin outer layer. It also gets more complicated once you have to interact with opaque SOAP servers or CLI utilities. Trade-offs, trade-offs. The most common occasion when I break this principle is when I need to simulate errors that aren&rsquo;t trivial to create organically: certain network conditions, timeouts, integrity errors, … In the end, it&rsquo;s less of a rule and more of a heuristic. Further reading To learn more about the principle check out That&rsquo;s Not Yours which takes a more database-centric approach and this summary in TestDouble &rsquo;s wiki. As with many things lately, this article was inspired by the wonderful Architecture Patterns with Python – the book that keeps transforming my gut feelings into principles like none before. Go and read it (for free on the web page if you want to). Harry also wrote a much more extensive treatise on this topic entitled Writing tests for external API calls‌ that offers more ideas and approaches. If you&rsquo;re interested in object-oriented programming, subclassing, and Python, I&rsquo;d like to recommend my magnum opus : Subclassing in Python Redux‌ Finally, this talk from 2012 has aged very well: Stop Mocking, Start Testing : Stop Mocking, Start Testing Hence the title of the post. No guarantees are given that you can read and comprehend this post in 5 minutes.&#160; &#8617;&#xfe0e; It originates in the London School of TDD – the one that loooves mocks.&#160; &#8617;&#xfe0e; My favorite tool for locally testing HTTP client libraries in Python is pytest-httpserver . vcr and its many ports to various languages has many fans, too. I&rsquo;m personally not one of them, because it works by monkeypatching HTTP clients and I prefer to keep my test code paths as close to production as possible. I find an in-process web server that returns canned responses much closer than magically replacing the client with a fake that runs entirely different code.&#160; &#8617;&#xfe0e; This post was made possible by the donations from people and corporations who appreciate my public work.

The ML methods they use have always been quite standard, they have been open about that. They just had the gall (or vision) to burn way more money than anyone else on scaling them up. The scale itself carries its own serious engineering challenges of course, but frankly they are not doing anything that any top-of-class CS post-grad couldn&#x27;t replicate with enough budget. It&#x27;s certainly hard, but it&#x27;s really not that special from an engineering standpoint. What is absolutely unprecedented is the social engineering and political acumen that allowed them to take such risks with so much money, walking that tightrope of mad ambition combined with good scientific discipline to make sure the money wouldn&#x27;t be completely wasted, and the vision for what was required to make LLMs actually commercially useful (instruction tuning, &quot;safety&#x2F;censoring&quot;...).

This is what Google Translate cannot currently do. Google Translate can&#x27;t, but LLMs given enough context can. I&#x27;ve been testing and experimenting with LLMs extensively for translation between Japanese and English for more than two years, and, when properly prompted, they are really good. I say this as someone who worked for twenty years as a freelance translator of Japanese and who still does translation part-time. Just yesterday, as it happens, I spent the day with Claude Code vibe-coding a multi-LLM system for translating between Japanese and English. You give it a text to be translated, and it asks you questions that it generates on the fly about the purpose of the translation and how you want it translated--literal or free, adapted to the target-language culture or not, with or without footnotes, etc. It then writes a prompt based on your answers, sends the text to models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, creates a combined draft from the three translations, and then sends that draft back to the three models for several rounds of revision, checking, and polishing. I had time to run only a few tests on real texts before going to bed, but the results were really good--better than any model alone when I&#x27;ve tested them, much better than Google Translate, and as good as top-level professional human translation. The situation is different with interpreting, especially in person. If that were how I made my living, I wouldn&#x27;t be too worried yet. But for straight translation work where the translator&#x27;s personality and individual identity aren&#x27;t emphasized, it&#x27;s becoming increasingly hard for humans to compete. reply Alex-Programs 33 minutes ago | parent | next [–] I&#x27;ve ended up doing a lot of research into LLM translation, because my language learning tool ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nuenki.app ) uses it a lot. I built something kinda similar, and made it open source. It picks the top x models based on my research, translates with them, then has a final judge model critique, compare, and synthesise a combined best translation. You can try it at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nuenki.app&#x2F;translator if you&#x27;re interested, and my data is at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nuenki.app&#x2F;blog reply felipeerias 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] It is hard to convey just how important it is to be able to provide additional context, ask follow-up questions, and reason about the text. I live in Japan. Almost every day I find myself asking things like “what does X mean in this specific setting?” or “how do I tell Y to that specific person via this specific medium?”. Much of this can be further automated via custom instructions, so that e.g. the LMM knows that text in a particular language should be automatically translated and explained. reply tkgally 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; It is hard to convey just how important it is to be able to ... ask follow-up questions, and reason about the text. Great ideas. I&#x27;ll think about adding those features to the system in my next vibe-coding session. What I automated in the MVP I vibe-coded yesterday could all be done alone by a human user with access to the LLMs, of course. The point of such an app would be to guide people who are not familiar with the issues and intricacies of translation so that they can get better translations for their purposes. I have no intention to try to commercialize my app, as there would be no moat. Anyone who wanted to could feed this thread to Claude, ask it to write a starting prompt for Claude Code, and produce a similar system in probably less time than it took me. reply aidenn0 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I&#x27;m bad with names, so for any Japanese literature, I need to take notes; it&#x27;s not unusual to see one character referred to by 3 names.

It can be as simple as discuss one’s own religion reply Alex-Programs 31 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] I made a tool which translates sentences as you browse, for immersion[0]. I solved this by giving the model a code (specifically, &quot;483&quot;) to return in any refusal. Then, if I detect that in the output, I fail over to another model+provider. I also have a few heuristics (e.g. &quot;I can&#x27;t translate&quot; in many different languages) to detect if it deviates from that. It works pretty well.

Second, the Pixar one is not &quot;mere&quot; translation; it is full localization because they changed the visual to match the &quot;textual&quot; change. The Pokemon one is where the change was limited to the &quot;text&quot;. The translator&#x27;s heart might have been in the right place (it would depend on how integral to the story it is that the item is onigiri) but didn&#x27;t have the authority to make the full breadth of changes needed for such adaptation to be successful. reply sodality2 12 hours ago | prev | next [–] This article is spot on about a lot of things. One thing I think it fails to address is this: &gt; I feel confident in asserting that people who say this would not have hired a translator or learned Japanese in a world without Google Translate; they’d have either not gone to Japan at all, or gone anyway and been clueless foreigners as tourists are wont to do. The correlation here would be something like: the people using AI to build apps previously would simply never have created an app, so it’s not affecting software development as a career as much as you first expect. It would be like saying AI art won’t affect artists, because the people who would put in such little effort probably would never have commissioned anyone. Which may be a little true (at least in that it reduces the impact). However, I don’t necessarily know if that’s true for software development. The ability to build software enabled huge business opportunities at very low costs. I think the key difference is this: the people who are now putting in such low effort into commissioning software maybe did hire software engineers before this, and that might throw off a lot of the numbers. reply MarkusQ 11 hours ago | parent | next [–] Conversely, it may create jobs.

There were always at least 3-5X as much work needing to be done, bugs needing to be fixed, features that needed to be implemented than engineers to do it. Backlogs just grew and grew until you just gave up and mass-closed issues because they were 10 years old. If AI coding improves productivity, it might move us closer to having 2X as much work as we can possibly do instead of 3X. reply SoftTalker 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don&#x27;t think you can judge &quot;work needing to be done&quot; by looking at backlog.

Meanwhile, the other effects you are talking about all started before AI coding even sort of worked well, and so have very little to do with AI: they are more related to monetary policy shifts, temporary pandemic demand spikes, and that R&amp;D tax law change. reply danielscrubs 27 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] But when everyone started to produce SEO slop, the web died.

First, because many problems were designed to fit into spreadsheets (human systems designed around a convenient tool). It is much more likely that several spreadsheets were _paper_ before, not custom written programs. For a lot of cases, that paper work was adapted directly to spreadsheets, no one did a custom program intermediate. Second, because many problems we have today could be solved by simple spreadsheets, but they often aren&#x27;t. Instead, people choose to hire developers instead, for a variety of reasons. reply tptacek 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re really disagreeing about anything here. If you think spreadsheets didn&#x27;t displace any programmers at all, that&#x27;s contrary to my intuition, but not necessarily wrong --- especially because of the explosion of extrinsic demand for computer programming. reply steveBK123 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Google translate is a good example too in terms of better-than-nothing to the completely uninitiated, helpful to someone with a little knowledge, and obviously not a replacement for a professional. That is - the more you know, the more you see its failures. I know enough Japanese to talk like a small child, make halting small talk in a taxi, and understand a dining menu &#x2F; restaurant signage broadly. I also have been enough times to understand context where literal translation to English fails to convey the actual message.. for example in cases where they want to say no to a customer but can&#x27;t literally say no. I have found Google Translate to be similarly magical and dumb for 15 years of traveling to Japan without any huge improvements other than speed.

The point of art is to create art. There are a lot of traditions and cultural expectations around this, and many of them depend on the artist involved. The human in the loop is important. Meanwhile, the point of software development is not to write code. It&#x27;s to get a working application that accomplishes a task. If this can be done, even at low quality, without hiring as many people, there is no more value to the human. In HN terms, there is no moat.

So you just have to either trust the translation and hope it&#x27;s the best. It&#x27;s a lot easier to trust a person than a machine, though I have had someone message me once to say &quot;this translation of your article is so bad I feel like the translator did not put in a serious attempt&quot; It&#x27;s similar to vibe coding where the user truly doesn&#x27;t know how to create the same thing themselves: You end up with output that you have no way of knowing it&#x27;s correct, and you just have to blindly trust it and hope for the best.

Google Translate fails this most of the times. This is true even between Hungarian and English. The difference with the latter one is, that I can properly choose between the options given to me, if there are, without translating it back. Especially, that that passed many times when it gave terrible translations. So this test fails many times, and even when not, the translation is still usually not good. However, when you don’t care about nuances, it’s still fine usually. And also translation seems to be better if the text is larger. Translating a single word does almost always fail. Translating a whole article is usually fine. But even there it matters what you translate. Translating the Austrian subreddit fails quite often. Sometimes completely for whole large posts.

To me, politeness is &quot;please&quot;, &quot;thank you&quot;, &quot;may I have&quot;, etc, whereas &quot;I would like a latte today&quot; reads to me as a demand. In context it&#x27;s fine (it stands out a bit but not in a problematic way), it&#x27;s not particularly rude, but in general just stating your desires is not considered polite in my experience in UK&#x2F;AU. There are some other parts of American English that may be considered polite, I notice a lot of US folks addressing me as &quot;sir&quot; for example, but this sort of thing comes off as insincere or even sarcastic&#x2F;rude. I know this is how people communicate so they don&#x27;t really bother me, I&#x27;m used to them and accept that different people have different expectations. I also understand that Americans might believe they are being polite and consider me to be rude, but I think this is why blanket statements like &quot;Americans are extremely polite&quot; are just missing so much cultural nuance. reply not_a_bot_4sho 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] America is not a monolith.

In Norwegian is still means &quot;want&quot;, and Google Translate indeed translates it as &quot;I want the potatoes.&quot; If you translate the rising (pleading) intonation on &quot;potatoes&quot;, you then have an unwritten &quot;please?&quot;, i.e. &quot;I want the potatoes ?...&quot;, which is passable English.

https://ingrids.space/posts/what-google-translate-can-tell-us-about-vibecoding/|What Google Translate Can Tell Us About Vibecoding | Ingrid&#39;s Space|Ingrid&rsquo;s Space λnfx.f (n f x) What Google Translate Can Tell Us About Vibecoding | Ingrid&#39;s Space What Google Translate Can Tell Us About Vibecoding Jun 17, 2025 6 minute read There has been rather a lot of doomsaying (and perhaps astroturfing) lately about LLMs as the end of computer programming. Much of the discussion has been lacking nuance, so I&rsquo;d like to add mine. I see claims from one side that &ldquo;I used $LLM_SERVICE_PROVIDER to make a small throwaway tool, so all programmers will be unemployed in $ARBITRARY_TIME_WINDOW &rdquo;, and from the other side flat-out rejections of the idea that this type of tool can have any utility. 1 I think it best sheds light on these claims to examine them in the context of another field that&rsquo;s been ahead of the curve on this: translation. Google translate has been around for a while, and has gone through some technological iterations; I&rsquo;m most interested in discussing its recent incarnations since the switch to neural machine translation in 2016. Over the years I&rsquo;ve heard much made about how this is the end of translation and interpretation as professions. I suspect the people who say such things have never actually worked with translator or interpreter. The emblematic example I&rsquo;ve encountered is &ldquo;I went on holiday to Japan and we used Google Translate everywhere, there&rsquo;s no need to hire an interpreter or learn Japanese anymore&rdquo;. While this undoubtedly speaks for the usefulness of current machine translation technology, the second half of the sentence calls for some scrutiny, particularly &ldquo;anymore&rdquo;. I feel confident in asserting that people who say this would not have hired a translator or learned Japanese in a world without Google Translate; they&rsquo;d have either not gone to Japan at all, or gone anyway and been clueless foreigners as tourists are wont to do. Indeed it turns out the number of available job opportunities for translators and interpreters has actually been increasing . This is not to say that the technology isn&rsquo;t good, I think it&rsquo;s pretty close to as good as it can be at what it does. It&rsquo;s also not to say that machine translation hasn&rsquo;t changed the profession of translation: in the article linked above, Bridget Hylak, a representative from the American Translators Association, is quoted as saying &ldquo;Since the advent of neural machine translation (NMT) around 2016, which marked a significant improvement over traditional machine translation like Google Translate, we [translators and interpreters] have been integrating AI into our workflows.&rdquo; To explain this apparent contradiction, we need to understand what it is translators actually do because, like us programmers, they suffer from having the nature of their work consistently misunderstood by non-translators. The laity&rsquo;s image of a translator is a walking dictionary and grammar reference, who substitutes words and and grammatical structures from one language to another with ease, the reality is that a translators&rsquo; and interpreters&rsquo; work is mostly about ensuring context, navigating ambiguity, and handling cultural sensitivity. This is what Google Translate cannot currently do. To give a simple example, Norwegian is an extremely closely related language to English and should be an easy translation candidate. The languages share a tonne of cognates, very similar grammar, and similar cultural context; even the idioms tend to translate verbatim. Yet there remain important cultural differences, and a particularly friction-prone one is Norwegian&rsquo;s lack of polite language. It&rsquo;s technically possible to say please in Norwegian (vær så snill, or vennligst), but Norwegians tend to prefer blunt communication, and these are not used much in practice. At the dinner table a Norwegian is likely to say something like &ldquo;Jeg vil ha potetene&rdquo; (literally &ldquo;I will have the potatoes&rdquo;, which sounds presumptuous and haughty in English) where a brit might say &ldquo;Could I please have some potatoes?&rdquo;. A good interpreter would have the necessary context for this (or ask for clarification if they&rsquo;re not sure) and provide a sensitive translation, Google Translate just gives the blunt direct translation. You can probably work past such misunderstandings at dinner with your foreign in-laws (and people do), but it should be apparent why it&rsquo;s inadvisable to subsititute Google Translate for an interpreter at a court hearing . And Norwegian is an easy case. Returning to our tourists, Japanese has wildly different grammar to English, including things like omitting subjects from sentences where it&rsquo;s apparent from context. In many of these cases you can&rsquo;t construct a grammatical English sentence without a subject, so Google translate will make one up. Would you be comfortable with a computer inserting a made up subject into your sentence? All this is not to say Google Translate is doing a bad job. Were I given &ldquo;Jeg vil ha potetene&rdquo; with no context or ability to clarify and asked to translate it to English, I&rsquo;d give the same answer. Maybe the person does want to be rude, how should I know? As a bilingual, I actually do make heavy use of Google Translate, but my use case isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a block of text, translate it for me&rdquo;. Instead I have more specific and subtle workflows like &ldquo;I already know what I want to say, how to say it, and can navigate cultural nuance, but I&rsquo;m not happy with my wording, I&rsquo;d like to see the most statistically likely way someone else might phrase this&rdquo; (A task language models really excel in, as it turns out). I suspect this is what Bridget Hylak meant when she said she has been integrating AI into her workflows (though I also suspect her tools and workflows are more sophisticated than mine). 2 It&rsquo;s a similar story for programming. I think it&rsquo;s even fair to characterise us as translators, just from squishy humans that speak in ambiguity and cultural nuance, to computers that deal only in absolutes. 3 There&rsquo;s the added complication that we create new abstractions a lot more aggressively in programming languages, and that&rsquo;s probably why it took machine translation to programming languagues a little while to catch up to machine translation between natural languages, but Big Tech™ chucked all of open source into a wood chipper, and we&rsquo;re there now. For what it&rsquo;s worth, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s inconceivable that some future form of AI could handle context and ambiguity as well as humans do, but I do think we&rsquo;re at least one more AI winter away from that, especially considering that today&rsquo;s AI moguls seem to have no capacity for nuance, and care more about their tools appearing slick and frictionless than providing responsible output. It is reasonable to say that the tools have limited utility though, and that the utility is outweighed by their negative externalities.&#160; &#x21a9;&#xfe0e; Even though I&rsquo;ve laid out this use case, I don&rsquo;t intend to take this up in practice anytime soon. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s nearly a groundbreaking enough productivity gain to be worth ignoring the fraught ethical status of the current tools.&#160; &#x21a9;&#xfe0e; I&rsquo;ve met plenty of programmers who really seem to believe our main function is to pump out code, and that more code is better. I&rsquo;d like to think having a code-barfing machine will show them the error in this, but unfortunately I expect a lot of them will continue to survive on pure organisational dysfunction.&#160; &#x21a9;&#xfe0e; Orientalism - to Fetish and Back Again About | Subscribe|9332daf5bacd7d6ae93e7b2881cf193b|1750241161

Share this post Chips and Cheese AMD’s CDNA 4 Architecture Announcement Copy link Facebook Email Notes More 4 1 Share CDNA 4 is AMD’s latest compute oriented GPU architecture, and represents a modest update over CDNA 3. CDNA 4’s focus is primarily on boosting AMD’s matrix multiplication performance with lower precision data types. Those operations are important for machine learning workloads, which can often maintain acceptable accuracy with very low precision types. At the same time, CDNA 4 seeks to maintain AMD’s lead in more widely applicable vector operations. To do so, CDNA 4 largely uses the same system level architecture as CDNA 3. It’s massive chiplet setup, with parallels to AMD’s successful use of chiplets for CPU products. Accelerator Compute Dies, or XCDs, contain CDNA Compute Units and serve a role analogous to Core Complex Dies (CCDs) on AMD’s CPU products. Eight XCDs sit atop four base dies, which implement 256 MB of memory side cache. AMD’s Infinity Fabric provides coherent memory access across the system, which can span multiple chips. Compared to the CDNA 3 based MI300X, the CDNA 4 equipped MI355X slightly cuts down CU count per XCD, and disables more CUs to maintain yields. The resulting GPU is somewhat less wide, but makes up much of the gap with higher clock speeds. Compared to Nvidia’s B200, both MI355X and MI300 are larger GPUs with far more basic building blocks. Nvidia’s B200 does adopt a multi-die strategy, breaking from a long tradition of using monolithic designs. However, AMD’s chiplet setup is far more aggressive and seeks to replicate their scaling success with CPU designs with large compute GPUs. Compute Unit Changes CDNA 3 provided a huge vector throughput advantage over Nvidia’s H100, but faced a more complicated situation with machine learning workloads. Thanks to a mature software ecosystem and a heavy focus on matrix multiplication throughput (tensor cores), Nvidia could often get close ( https://chipsandcheese.com/p/testing-amds-giant-mi300x ) to the nominally far larger MI300X. AMD of course maintained massive wins if the H100 ran out of VRAM, but there was definitely room for improvement. CDNA 4 rebalances its execution units to more closely target matrix multiplication with lower precision data types, which is precisely what machine learning workloads use. Per-CU matrix throughput doubles in many cases, with CDNA 4 CUs matching Nvidia’s B200 SMs in FP6. Elsewhere though, Nvidia continues to show a stronger emphasis on low precision matrix throughput. B200 SMs have twice as much per-clock throughput as a CDNA 4 CU across a range of 16-bit and 8-bit data types. AMD continues to rely on having a bigger, higher clocked GPU to maintain an overall throughput lead. With vector operations and higher precision data types, AMD continues MI300X’s massive advantage. Each CDNA 4 CU continues to have 128 FP32 lanes, which deliver 256 FLOPS per cycle when counting FMA operations. MI355X’s lower CU count does lead to a slight reduction in vector performance compared to MI300X. But compared to Nvidia’s Blackwell, AMD’s higher core count and higher clock speeds let it maintain a huge vector throughput lead. Thus AMD’s CDNA line continues to look very good for high performance compute workloads. Nvidia’s focus on machine learning and matrix operations keeps them very competitive in that category, despite having fewer SMs running at lower clocks. AMD’s giant MI355X holds a lead across many data types, but the gap between AMD and Nvidia’s largest GPUs isn’t nearly as big as with vector compute. Larger LDS GPUs provide a software managed scratchpad local to a group of threads, typically ones running on the same core. AMD GPUs use a Local Data Share, or LDS, for that purpose. Nvidia calls their analogous structure Shared Memory. CDNA 3 had a 64 KB LDS, carrying forward a similar design from AMD GCN GPUs going back to 2012. That LDS had 32 2 KB banks, each 32 bits wide, providing up to 128 bytes per cycle in the absence of bank conflicts. CDNA 4 increases the LDS capacity to 160 KB and doubles read bandwidth to 256 bytes per clock. GPUs natively operate on 32 bit elements, and it would be reasonable to assume AMD doubled bandwidth by doubling bank count. If so, each bank may now have 2.5 KB of capacity. Another possibility would be increasing bank count to 80 while keeping bank size at 2 KB, but that’s less likely because it would complicate bank selection. A 64-banked LDS could naturally serve a 64-wide wavefront access with each bank serving a lane. Furthermore, a power-of-two bank count would allow simple bank selection via a subset of address bits. The larger LDS lets software keep more data close to the execution units. Kernels can allocate more LDS capacity without worrying about lower occupancy due to LDS capacity constraints. For example, a kernel that allocates 16 KB of LDS could run four workgroups on a CDNA 3 CU. On CDNA 4, that would increase to ten workgroups. Software has to explicitly move data into the LDS to take advantage of it, which can introduce overhead compared to using a hardware-managed cache. CDNA 3 had GLOBAL_LOAD_LDS instructions that let kernels copy data into the LDS without going through the vector register file, CDNA 4 augments GLOBAL_LOAD_LDS to support moving up to 128 bits per lane, versus 32 bits per lane on CDNA 3. That is, the GLOBAL_LOAD_LDS instruction can accept sizes of 1, 2, 4, 12, or 16 DWORDS (32-bit elements), versus just 1, 2, or 4 on CDNA 3. 1 CDNA 4 also introduces read-with-transpose LDS instructions. Matrix multiplication involves multiplying elements of a row in one matrix with corresponding elements in a second matrix’s column. Often that creates inefficient memory access patterns, for at least one matrix, depending on whether data is laid out in row-major or column-major order. Transposing a matrix turns the awkward row-to-column operation into a more natural row-to-row one. Handling transposition at the LDS is also natural for AMD’s architecture, because the LDS already has a crossbar that can map bank outputs to lanes (swizzle). Even with its LDS capacity increase, AMD continues to have less data storage within its GPU cores compared to Nvidia. Blackwell’s SMs have a 256 KB block of storage partitioned for use as both L1 cache and Shared Memory. Up to 228 KB can be allocated for use as Shared Memory. With a 164 KB Shared Memory allocation, which is close to matching AMD’s 160 KB LDS, Nvidia would still have 92 KB available for L1 caching. CDNA 4, like CDNA 3, has a 32 KB L1 vector cache per CU. Thus a Blackwell SM can have more software managed storage while still having a larger L1 cache than a CDNA 4 CU. Of course, AMD’s higher CU count means there’s 40 MB of LDS capacity across the GPU, while Nvidia only has ~33 MB of Shared Memory across B200 with the largest 228 KB Shared Memory allocation. System Architecture To feed the massive arrays of Compute Units, MI355X largely uses the same system level architecture as MI300X. MI355X does see a few enhancements though. The L2 caches can “writeback dirty data and retain a copy of the line”. “Dirty” refers to data that has been modified in a write-back cache, but hasn’t been propagated to lower levels in the memory subsystem. When a dirty line is evicted to make room for newer data, its contents are written back to the next level of cache, or DRAM if it’s the last level cache. AMD may be seeking to opportunistically use write bandwidth when the memory subsystem is under low load, smoothing out spikes in bandwidth demand caused by cache fill requests accompanied by writebacks. Or, AMD could be doing something special to let the L2 transition a line to clean state if written data is likely to be read by other threads across the system, but isn’t expected to be modified again anytime soon. MI355X’s DRAM subsystem has been upgraded to use HBM3E, providing a substantial bandwidth and capacity upgrade over its predecessor. It also maintains AMD’s lead over its Nvidia competition. Nvidia also uses HBM3E with the B200, which also appears to have eight HBM3E stacks. However, the B200 tops out at 180 GB of capacity and 7.7 TB/s of bandwidth, compared to 288 GB at 8 TB/s on the MI355X. The MI300X could have a substantial advantage over Nvidia’s older H100 when the H100 ran out of DRAM capacity, and AMD is likely looking to retain that advantage. Higher bandwidth from HBM3E also helps bring up MI355X’s compute-to-bandwidth ratio. MI300X had ~0.03 bytes of DRAM bandwidth per FP32 FLOP, which increases to 0.05 on MI355X. Blackwell for comparison has ~0.10 bytes of DRAM bandwidth per FP32 FLOP. While Nvidia has increased last level cache capacity on Blackwell, AMD continues to lean more heavily on big caches, while Nvidia relies more on DRAM bandwidth. Final Words CDNA 2 and CDNA 3 made sweeping changes compared to their predecessors. CDNA 4’s changes are more muted. Much like going from Zen 3 to Zen 4, MI355X retains a similar chiplet arrangement with compute and IO chiplets swapped out for improved versions. Rather than changing up their grand strategy, AMD spent their time tuning CDNA 3. Fewer, higher clocked CUs are easier to utilize, and increased memory bandwidth can help utilization too. Higher matrix multiplication throughput also helps AMD take on Nvidia for machine learning workloads. In some ways, AMD’s approach with this generation has parallels to Nvidia’s. Blackwell SMs are basically identical to Hopper’s from a vector execution perspective, with improvements focused on the matrix side. Nvidia likely felt they had a winning formula, as their past few GPU generations have undoubtedly been successful. AMD may have found a winning formula with CDNA 3 as well. MI300A, MI300X’s iGPU cousin, powers the highest ranking supercomputer on TOP500’s June list. 4 Building on success can be a safe and rewarding strategy, and CDNA 4 may be doing just that.

I know UDNA is rumored to represent a fusion of CDNA and RDNA, implying that some design ideas will be kept from each. I know RDNA4's OOO abilities are unique, but I don't know if there would even be a theoretical benefit to adopting a similar approach for AI or HPC workloads.

When you are stuck at work, it will give you a push. Even if it is not completely right, it is enough to get you moving. The feeling of &quot;no longer fighting alone at work&quot; is actually more important than many people think. reply pyman 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] I asked my students to write a joke about AI. Sometimes humor is the best way to get people to talk about their fears without filters. One of them wrote: &quot;I went to work early that day and noticed my monitor was on, and code was being written without anyone pressing any keys. Something had logged into my machine and was writting code. I ran to my boss and told him my computer had been hacked. He looked at me, concerned, and said I was hallucinating. It&#x27;s not a hacker, he said. It&#x27;s our new agent. While you were sleeping, it built the app we needed. Remember that promotion you always wanted? Well, good news buddy! I&#x27;m promoting you to Prompt Manager. It&#x27;s half the money, but you get to watch TikTok videos all day long!&#x27;&quot; Hard to find any real reassurance in that story. reply psunavy03 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] &quot;Great news, boss!

I&#x27;m sure you know that. SQL had similar claims... Declarative, say what you need and the computer will do for you. Also written in English. reply ako 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] And compared to what we had before SQL, it is much easier to use, and a lot more people are able to use it. reply noworriesnate 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] But software developers often struggle to use sql and prefer using ORMs or analytical APIs like polars; the people who excel at sql are typically not programmers, they’re data engineers, DBAs, analysts, etc. Maybe a similar bifurcation will arise where there are vibe coders who use LLMs to write everything, and there are real engineers who avoid LLMs. Maybe we’re seeing the beginning of that with the whole bifurcation of programmers into two camps: heavy AI users and AI skeptics. reply ruszki 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] What you can achieve with the standard SQL is taught on universities. The whole package. I’ve never met a developer, who struggled with that. When you use ORMs you need to follow SQL’s logic anyway. People use ORMs to avoid painful data conversions. Not to avoid the logic. Data engineers, DBAs, analysts, etc excel in specific databases, not in “SQL”. reply FranzFerdiNaN 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Ive worked in BI and data engineering my whole career and I’ve met plenty of programmers who struggled immensely with SQL once it went further than select and group by. And don’t get me started about their database design skills. It’s way too often a disaster hidden behind “it works for the software so good enough”. Im more surprised by software engineers who do know these things than by the ones who don’t. reply maccard 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I’ve worked with gameplay programmers who can’t do simple 3D math, c++ programmers who fundamentally don’t understand pointers, backend developers who didn’t understand globals were shared state and cause race conditions, etc. It’s not that SQL is hard, it’s that for any discipline the vast majority of people don’t have a solid grasp of the tools they’re using. Ask most tradespeople about the underlying thing they’re working with and you’ll have the same problem. reply adalacelove 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I&#x27;m a developer and: - I hate ORMs, they are the source for a lot of obscure errors behind layers and layers of abstractions. - I prefer analytical APIs for technical reasons, not just the language. Reasons: - I can compose queries, which in turn makes them easier to decompose - It&#x27;s easier to spot errors - I avoid parsing SQL strings - It&#x27;s easier to interact with the rest of the code, both functions and objects If I need to make just a query I gladly write SQL reply eru 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Well, the problem in ORM is the O. Objection-orientation is just a worse way to organise your data and logic than relational algebra. It&#x27;s just a shame that many languages don&#x27;t support relational algebra well. We had relations as a datatype and all the relevant operations over them (like join) in a project I was working on. It was great! Very useful for expressing business logic. reply tpm 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The problem in ORM is the M, the mapping is always lossy and a leaky abstraction. reply idiotsecant 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &#x27;real&#x27; engineers can use SQL just fine. This is a strange position to take. reply sanderjd 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; But software developers often struggle to use sql Is this true? It doesn&#x27;t seem true to me. reply nathanfig 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Claude made this point while reviewing my blog for me: the mechanization of farms created a whole lot more specialization of roles. The person editing CAD diagrams of next year&#x27;s combine harvester may not be a farmer strictly speaking, but farming is still where their livelihood comes from. reply lipowitz 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Removing jobs that could only be performed by those living near the particular fields with those that can be done anywhere makes jobs for the person willing to take the least satisfactory compensation for the most skill and work. Working the summer fields was one of the least desirable jobs but still gave local students with no particular skills a good supplemental income appropriate for whichever region. reply miki123211 12 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] depending on the job, it may also allow you to select for talent much better, which creates intense competition and raises salaries significantly. A good example of this phenomenon is sports. Even thought it can&#x27;t be done remotely, it&#x27;s so talent dependent that it&#x27;s often better to find a great player in a foreign country and ask them to work for you, rather than relying exclusively on local talent. If it could be a remote job, this effect would be even greater. reply eru 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yes, but automating these away means that food becomes cheaper. We increase the overall total prosperity with that automation. reply lipowitz 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Increasing total prosperity is the wrong goal if distribution is completely unregulated. Investor and real estate owning classes like the 1% get more, the salaries can trend down because food costs are down, in a deflation spiral the youth are perpetual dependents and&#x2F;or debtors who can&#x27;t possibly earn enough over day to day costs given global competition includes people with no debts or debts from an economy that was less wealthy. reply dredmorbius 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Strictly speaking, farming is where all our livelihoods come from, in the greatest part. We&#x27;re all living off the surplus value of food production. (Also of other food, energy, and materials sourcing: fishing, forestry, mining, etc.) This was the insight of the French economist François Quesnay in his Tableau économique , foundation of the Physiocratic school of economics. reply eru 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You might find https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Margarine#Coal_butter fascinating. &gt; Strictly speaking, farming is where all our livelihoods come from, in the greatest part. We&#x27;re all living off the surplus value of food production. I don&#x27;t think farming is special here, because food isn&#x27;t special. You could make exactly the same argument for water (or even air) instead of food, and all of a sudden all our livelihoods would derive ultimately from the local municipal waterworks. Whether that&#x27;s a reductio ad absurdum of the original argument, or a valuable new perspective on the local waterworks is left as an exercise to the reader. reply ameliaquining 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Is that really because of the English-esque syntax, rather than because it was a step forward in semantic expressivity? If SQL looked like, say, C#&#x27;s LINQ method syntax, would it really be harder to use? reply 9rx 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; Is that really because of the English-esque syntax Well, what we had before SQL[1] was QUEL, which is effectively the same as Alpha[2], except in &quot;English&quot;. Given the previous assertion about what came before SQL, clearly not. I expect SQL garnered favour because it is tablational instead of relational, which is the quality that makes it easier to understand for those not heavy in the math.

I disagree with the &quot;only&quot; part here. Imagine a distribution curve of photos with shitty photos on the left and masterpieces on the right and the height at the curve is how many photos there are to be seen at that quality. The digital camera transition massively increased the height of the curve at all points. And thanks to things like better autofocus, better low light performance, and a radically faster iteration loop, it probably shift the low and middle ends to the right. It even certainly increased the number number of breathtaking, life-changing photos out there. Digital cameras are game-changes for photographic journalists traveling in difficult locations. However... the curve is so high now, the sheer volume of tolerably good photos so overwhelming, that I suspect that average person actually sees fewer great photos than they did twenty years ago. We all spend hours scrolling past nice-but-forgottable sunset shots on Instagram and miss out on the amazing stuff. We are drowning in a sea of &quot;pretty good&quot;.

With enough practice of that skill you could be a professional photographer, which would be a good , reliable, well paid job. Now, the barrier of entry is nothing, so it&#x27;s extremely competitive to be a professional photographer, and even the ones that succeed just scrape by.

Presumably, the LLM user will have sufficient brain capacity to verify that the result works as they have imagined (however incomplete the mental picture might be). They then have an opportunity to tweak, in real time (of sorts), to make the output closer to what they want. Repeat this as many times as needed&#x2F;time available, and the output gets to be quite sufficient for purpose.

Welcome! Just, don’t skip out on learning the fundamentals. There’s no royal road to knowledge and skill. No shortcuts. No speed running, downloading kung fu, no passing go. Why? Because the only thing LLMs do is hallucinate. Often what they generate is what you’re looking for. It’s the right answer! But if you don’t know what and L1 cache is or how to lay out data for SIMD; no amount of yelling at the bot is going to fix the poor performance, the security errors, and the logic errors. If you don’t know what to ask you won’t know what you’re looking at. And you won’t know how to fix it.

Why wouldn&#x27;t it be? You&#x27;re not actually hosting a tracker in this case, only looking at incoming connections. And even if you do run a tracker, hard to make the case that the tracker itself is illega. Hosting something like opentrackr is like hosting a search engine, how they respond to legal takedown requests is where the crux is at, and whatever infra sits around the tracker, so police and courts can see&#x2F;assume the intent. But trackers are pretty stupid coordination server software, would be crazy if they became illegal. reply jekwoooooe 15 hours ago | parent | next [–] Is this legal isn’t a useful question. The better question is how likely are you to get sued? With civil lawsuits it doesn’t matter if it’s legal you can be sued and harassed by lawyers if you get on their radar. reply chaboud 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] This is definitely the right pragmatic take. A lawyer friend of mine once laid it out for me: &quot;in litigation, if you go to court, even if you win, you lose&quot;. The reality is that court sucks, and getting sued sucks for all but the ultra-wealthy (who can absorb the cost).

His case was bolstered by asking to be put on their no call list and then them ignoring that, but the point is the vast majority of people don’t do it even if in theory they could.

Your post seemingly dropped everything but the first sentence from the context window and then wrote vapid fluff that makes no sense in context. reply gpm 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Because knowingly helping people commit crimes generally counts the same as committing the crime yourself.

There are a few internet&#x2F;copyright safe harbor provisions (in the US) that might maybe (probably not) make it not a crime, I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not a lawyer. But your general thought when you hear &quot;helping someone else commit a crime&quot; ought to be &quot;that&#x27;s probably a crime itself&quot;. reply rockskon 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Wouldn&#x27;t particular knowledge be required? I&#x27;m sure Google devs know in the abstract that Google search is used by criminals to help them in committing crimes, but that clearly is not illegal in and of itself. reply gpm 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There&#x27;s definitely a mens rea requirement here, that you know that a crime is being committed and that you intend to facilitate it. I doubt it requires particularized knowledge that &quot;this specific request&quot; is for a crime... I&#x27;m still not a lawyer. Running a service primarily for legal purposes that some criminals can take advantage of is pretty different with regards to intent than reviving an old domain name that you know is primarily used by old illegal torrents as a tracker. I spent a few minutes googling, and it seems like that at least as of a decade ago the exact bounds here weren&#x27;t well defined: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scotusblog.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;03&#x2F;opinion-analysis-justice-... &gt; Finally, the possible liability for an “incidental facilitator” – such as a firearms dealer who knows that some customers will use their purchases for crime – is noted but not resolved. Thus, thankfully, there is still some fertile ground for hypotheticals with which we practicing law professors can bedevil our students. reply drob518 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] IANAL, but I would think you’d also have to have specific mens rea. That is, it’s not illegal to use a torrent or facilitate a torrent, because it’s just a protocol that can be used for good or bad. If you were hosting movies and songs, whatever the protocol, that’s when you’re specifically engaging in piracy. It’s sort of like driving a car isn’t illegal, but being the getaway driver for a bank robbery is, even if you never enter the bank. The car isn’t the problem, it’s what you are using it for. It’s also not illegal to sell a car to a bank robber, even if that’s a possibility, unless you reasonably believe that the particular person you were selling it to is a bank robber and will be using it to commit a crime. The mere fact that somebody could use your tracker for piracy doesn’t loop you into the conspiracy unless you specifically know that they are committing piracy. This is why the telecom companies all have carve outs for this sort of thing. Carrying packets or voice traffic of someone planning a crime doesn’t loop the telecom company into the conspiracy. reply gpm 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s illegal to &quot;run a torrent tracker&quot;. When Blizzard use to (pre 2015) update Starcraft via torrent I assume they ran their own tracker for that, and that was totally legal. Even if there was some way for a pirate to take advantage of the Blizzard tracker. Here it&#x27;s not the &quot;mere fact that somebody could use your tracker for piracy&quot;.

He chose it because he observed it was previously in use as a tracker for copyright infringing torrents. The police&#x2F;courts&#x2F;jury is not obliged to put blinders on just because you would prefer if they did. The mere fact that the domain name was previously used for this is almost certainly probable cause to get search warrants that will almost certainly provide the requisite proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he has in fact intentionally both committed himself, and aided others in committing (because he knew what the domain name was, or at least recognized it as similar to demonoid and could guess), copyright infringement. And that&#x27;s without the blog post... (which I assume in the hypothetical where he chose to keep running this he would not have posted). reply necovek 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] They explicitly used it to download &quot;Linux isos&quot;, which are highly likely not copyright infringing (they are usually free to distribute).

Google can hire expensive lawyers, so it&#x27;s fine. reply awesome_dude 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] IANAL, but I would think that Google&#x27;s customers are overwhelmingly using the service for &quot;legitimate&quot; activities, and Google makes attempts to limit use of their tools in the commission of a crime. It&#x27;s kind of like Kim Dotcom&#x27;s defence of his systems where he was saying that he was making attempts to remove content from his systems in compliance with DCMA requests. That is, the claim is his systems were legal because even though people were using them for illegitimate purposes, he was actively working to prevent that from happening. reply diggan 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; knowingly helping people commit crimes generally Right, that makes sense.

IANAL but this clearly shows the OP didn&#x27;t intend to facilitate crime and shut it down after seeing that was what may have been happening. reply gpm 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I, and I think OP, were both addressing the hypothetical in which he continued to run the service, not the reality where he quickly shut it down. &gt; But the OP states he was using the tracker for lawful purposes: That quote is a confession that he was committing copyright infringement. Courts and juries and not obliged to ignore the &quot;, uh,&quot; part. Probably (in the very unlikely event where he is charged) the best defence would be &quot;this was a joke&quot; not &quot;I didn&#x27;t literally confess to committing copyright infringement&quot;. Even then I&#x27;m pretty sure this quote would weigh against him substantially in just about any jury&#x27;s mind. reply senko 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; That quote is a confession that he was committing copyright infringement.

Known malicious trackers usually inject stuff in the sense that e.g. there is a payload to all known PDF files appended with a payload that targets the clients&#x27; OS. The announcement related APIs are fairly easy to implement, but I wouldn&#x27;t bet on it being implemented in a fuzzed testing environment. Transmission, for example, had multiple vulnerabilities over the years. Not sure about the other client implementations. reply Sophira 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Don&#x27;t torrents have a checksum hash, though? Or is it one of the broken hashing algorithms like MD5? reply cookiengineer 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That&#x27;s correct. Most clients revalidate stuff after the download has been completed. Depending on how well they can redownload chunks (e.g. web seeds sometimes don&#x27;t allow that if the web server does not support 206 Partial Content headers) you might have to redownload the file completely afterwards. I had different experiences with different clients, so I guess it&#x27;s work in progress on what a client does when the cache was poisoned. Hashing algos are mostly SHA based ones that are used.

But it was a toy, never got serious enough to look deeper at how the tracker worked (was using the rust Aquatic tracker, which kindly added webtorrent support on request! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;greatest-ape&#x2F;aquatic ) Does the tracker know what it&#x27;s tracking? Is there any attempt to make the tracker unaware of what peer rendezvous it&#x27;s doing? My gut is that it seems some kind of hash&#x2F;magnet that folks are asking to peers on. And that the magnet itself is sufficient, and doesn&#x27;t have to include anything identifying (although I believe many magnet links included some human readable description). The tracker could likely try to download this hash from the peer itself, to get the torrent info, but wouldn&#x27;t really know what the torrent is or what&#x27;s in it without doing the download itself. Does that check out? How much of the magnet link is key to rendezvous? Could a tracker ignore human friendly fields, block them at ingress, to shield it&#x27;s eyes? reply daneel_w 11 hours ago | parent | next [–] The trackers only deal with torrents&#x27; info hash. No names, no descriptions, no list of contents, no nothing. opentracker , to use OP&#x27;s chosen software as example, can run in both white- and blacklist mode (or whatever equivalent terminology it uses today). The former is self-explanatory, and the latter allows all hashes except the blacklisted ones. All open trackers, such as torrent.eu and opentrackr.org to name a couple, always operate in a blacklist fashion in order to openly accommodate any users to congregate for (almost) any content. reply qingcharles 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The tracker knows what it is tracking. I used to run a TV show tracker. It would keep track of all the users upload&#x2F;download ratios. reply aeyes 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The blog post is about a public tracker. What you describe is a private tracker which embeds a client identifier into the announce URL of the torrent. On a public tracker the only way to identify a user is the IP address and that&#x27;s not reliable. reply jldugger 13 hours ago | prev | next [–] In other words, you can DDoS any ip for the cost of registering a domain and publishing a specific DNS record. reply 57473m3n7Fur7h3 12 hours ago | parent | next [–] Is it really going to be all that bad? The BitTorrent clients I’ve used all seemed pretty polite, backing off for like 60s at least for each tracker they can’t connect to. If you buy one of the dead tracker domains and point it at an IP of someone else, but their services aren’t even listening on the port client wants to connect to (and don’t speak BitTorrent even if the port happened to coincide), I can’t imagine that even with a million BitTorrent clients wanting to connect it would really be all that much of a problem. reply jldugger 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It can be: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jwz.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;chinese-bittorrent-the-gift... reply globular-toast 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Careful.

Most utility software you need is free, save for a few programs you can easily find on Russian torrents. 2. Most games and other media are slop. Torrents didn&#x27;t die because US law enforcement made them die. Torrents died because most companies realized that providing slop with ads and lootboxes for free is a much better business model than trying to get people to pay for something of quality. Imagine trying to tell someone in year 2000 that Windows will natively display ads, EA will lose lawsuits related to FIFA being actual old-fashioned gambling, and music industry will push for AI-generated content.

It was going slowly, so I opened up the Trackers tab in qBittorrent and saw the following: Most of the trackers were totally dead. Either the hosts were down or the domains weren’t being used. That got me thinking. What if I picked up one of these dead domains? How many clients would try to connect? What are trackers for, anyways? A tracker is a core component of the BitTorrent protocol . Trackers are the services that point you to other peers for the torrent. Without trackers, there would be no one to share the file with. Obviously this represents a major source of centralization in the torrent protocol. If your trackers aren’t maintained – or if they get forced offline by certain industry organizations – you’re out of luck. We have an alternative, called Mainline DHT , which performs a more decentralized lookup of peers based on infohash alone. DHT isn’t perfect, though. It relies on bootstrap nodes and is vulnerable to Sybil attacks . And in the example of my poorly-served torrent, DHT wasn’t surfacing any peers, regardless. Hosting a tracker Looking through the list of trackers marked “host not found”, I noticed udp://open.demonii.si:1337/announce was available. I bought the domain through Dynadot (one of the few .si domain registrars), then spun up a quick anonymous VPS . I mapped the domain to the VPS, then set up opentracker , the most widely used and robust torrent tracker software. Instructions for Ubuntu 24.04: sudo apt install gcc-14 g++-14 build-essential zlib1g-dev sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-14 14 sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-14 14 Follow the readme to compile, first the dependency libowfat (a GPL reimplementation of some of dan bernstein ’s C libraries) and then opentracker itself. cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.fefe.de:/cvs -z9 co libowfat cd libowfat make cd .. git clone git://erdgeist.org/opentracker cd opentracker make Finally, a quick systemd unit file to daemonize this service: [ Unit] Description = opentracker After = network-online.target Wants = network-online.target [ Service] Type = simple User = opentracker Group = opentracker WorkingDirectory = /var/lib/opentracker ExecStart = /home/opentracker/opentracker/opentracker -p 1337 -P 1337 \ -d /var/lib/opentracker -u opentracker Restart = on-failure LimitNOFILE = 65536 [ Install] WantedBy = multi-user.target What did I find? Before even starting opentracker, I saw a flood of traffic against UDP port 1337: I then started the tracker. After about an hour, it peaked at about 1.7 million distinct torrents across 3.1 million peers!

Maybe. When the recording industry and other litigious organizations go after torrent trackers, they’re mainly chasing down the public-facing parts of the system. The legal decisions against websites like The Pirate Bay hinge on how they highlight popular movies, sell ads, and offer .torrent files. This is all taken as evidence of inducement , meaning the intentional promotion of copyright infringement. Does hosting tracker infrastructure, unadvertised, count as “inducement”? It’s a harder case to make. I’m aware that many torrents, both freely available and copyrighted, use this tracker. But it would be more difficult to prove intent here. Regardless, I was spooked. I thought through my chain of events and realized I had already fucked up by paying for the domain with a credit card. I shut down the VPS and deleted the domain quickly after confirming it works. So… the domain is available now. It’s quite easy to find unclaimed domains like this. If you want to do a public service, open.demonii.si and others are up for registration… Kian Bradley fafrd|dd40387bb2d656eb6eb275883e10697f|1750241164

It even shows the token count, making it super handy for LLM prompts! Hi, HN! I often copy information from the web into my notes (Obsidian) or to feed context to LLMs for summaries&#x2F;translations. So I built cpdown, a browser extension for this. cpdown lets you convert any webpage&#x2F;youtube subtitle into clean Markdown and copy it to your clipboard with a single click (or a keyboard shortcut). Here are the key features: * Intelligent Content Extraction: Uses Mozilla&#x27;s Readability or Defuddle (by the Obsidian devs!) to strip away ads, sidebars, and other noise, focusing only on the main article content. * Clean Markdown Conversion: The extracted HTML is then neatly converted to Markdown using the Turndown library. * Token Count for LLMs: It calculates and displays the token count of the copied text using tiktoken. This is super handy for knowing if you&#x27;re within limits before pasting into LLMs like ChatGPT or Claude. * YouTube Transcript Copying: On YouTube video pages, it can copy the full transcript in Markdown format, automatically adding the video title as an H1 header. * Customizable Options: You can choose your preferred content extractor (Readability&#x2F;Defuddle), opt to wrap copied content in a code block, and more. cpdown is completely free and open-source, built with WXT, React, and TypeScript. You can grab it from the Chrome Web Store or check out the source code on GitHub. I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback, feature requests, or any suggestions! * Chrome Web Store: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromewebstore.google.com&#x2F;detail&#x2F;cpdown&#x2F;knnaflplggjd ... * GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ysm-dev&#x2F;cpdown Thanks for checking it out! voiper1 1 hour ago [–] Chrome web store link got truncated, this is the link from github: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromewebstore.google.com&#x2F;detail&#x2F;cpdown&#x2F;knnaflplggjd...

Thinking of it, I should go re-read it now. reply the_arun 8 hours ago | prev | next [–] Nicely written. I liked the Car Talk captions. Would have loved to see larger images though. But I understand this is from 1998. reply neilv 9 hours ago | prev | next [–] Up until a few years ago, I could&#x27;ve seen doing this as a worthwhile survival exercise, and to know that I can do it. Then, without trying, I overheated simply by exercising in a room that I didn&#x27;t know was 95F. (Since I&#x27;ve mostly only lived in cold&#x2F;moderate climates, and had never learned how risky 95F is.) It was highly unpleasant, in an uh-oh, I can see how people die this way, kind of way. Now, I actively avoid anywhere much hotter than about 80F. Just last week, I declined a very interesting recruiting outreach from a CEO in Austin, telling him, sorry, but the weather in Texas is just too hot for me. I&#x27;m ready to repurpose the term &quot;special snowflake&quot;. &gt; A young woman seems to be walking around in a daze. [...] I don&#x27;t think they believed their guidebooks about how uncomfortably hot it can get in Death Valley. I hope someone helped the dazed person with first aid. And that other people take the heat seriously. It&#x27;s right there in the name: Death Valley. reply dkarl 8 hours ago | parent | next [–] Your reaction to heat is highly dependent on acclimation. I live in Texas and have to re-acclimate every year. Exercising on the first 85º+ day of the year is miserable, but a month later 85º feels quite tolerable, and 95º is doable, though performance suffers. I grew up playing baseball and tennis in 95-100º weather with high humidity routinely. It wasn&#x27;t pleasant, but nobody was getting heatstroke, nobody was cancelling games or practices. But on a visit to Montana a few summers ago, I saw that kids&#x27; baseball games had been cancelled because the temperatures had reach a dangerous level: 90º (in dry mountain air.) Same human beings, different levels of acclimation, very different safety thresholds. I&#x27;ve never been in the temperatures described in this article, though, and I don&#x27;t know what the physical limits of acclimation are. reply Jtsummers 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The &quot;trick&quot; I used in GA (not quite as hot as TX, but as humid in that part of GA) was to exercise outside year round. It was rarely so cold that winter running was a problem, and as the temperatures warm up or cool down you naturally get acclimated to the new season. It&#x27;s worked here in CO as well (though due to an injury I didn&#x27;t this past winter) with getting used to very cold temperatures (I wouldn&#x27;t exercise outdoors on our very coldest days, but that&#x27;s about 1-2 weeks out of the entire winter that I&#x27;d stick to indoor only training). reply GJim 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; Your reaction to heat is highly dependent on acclimation. And the other way around. I once went to a conference, held in early spring, at a Greek hotel. It was 15 C and the hotel staff had closed the pool as it was &quot;too cold&quot; to swim. Us Brits were puzzled. The Finns were utterly baffled. reply readthenotes1 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The first exercise at 105⁰ seems insane. A week later bearable. I recall with some amusement thinking I was coming down with heat stroke one summerbecause the light wind felt chilly on my skin. But then I realized it was only 95 degrees reply js2 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] What really matters is the wet bulb temp. For example, the Death Valley high today was 114°F (45°C) but at an RH of only 3%. That gives a wet bulb temp of ~ 65°F which isn&#x27;t a problem with acclimation and adequate hydration. Now if it had been 50% RH, the web bulb temp would be &gt; 96°F which is not survivable by humans for very long because no amount of sweating in that humidity will cool you down. reply lazyasciiart 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] A young couple and their baby and dog died of overheating on a day hike in California a few years ago. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;dec&#x2F;12&#x2F;tragic-death... reply close04 49 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Taking a 1 year old on an 8mi&#x2F;13km hike in an area where temps go to 109F&#x2F;43C, with inadequate clothing and only 2.5l of water for 2 adults, the child, and the dog is insane. reply JKCalhoun 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Bike riding in the heat once caused me to come close to overheating. Stopping, finding shade, pouring water over my head and laying down finally brought my core temperature down in time. I saw the same things begin to happen to my wife some years later when bike riding in the heat. I did the same for her and all was well. reply tbrownaw 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; Now, I actively avoid anywhere much hotter than about 80F. It is currently - well after sunset - 82°F outside. A couple days ago it was mid-90s in the afternoon, and it should get back to that after the current weather passes in another few days. Mowing the yard when it&#x27;s high 90s and muggy and sunny is not as rare an occurrence as I might like. reply desi_ninja 5 hours ago | prev | next [–] Looks like the same guy : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.turtletrader.com&#x2F;dinesh-desai&#x2F; reply pbhowmic 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] That&#x27;s Death Valley Dinesh!!

https://dineshdesai.info/dv/photos.html||Dinesh's Death Walk: Photo Album The following is an account of our walk through Death Valley National Park during July 1998. We wanted to find out how it feels to walk in extreme heat for days at a time. We had set a goal of walking the entire park, from its northern boundary to its southernmost point, a distance of about 180 miles. Our plan was to walk 15 miles a day and finish the walk in 12 days.

Today, we’re taking the next step with our 2.5 Pro and Flash models by releasing them as stable and generally available. And we’re bringing you 2.5 Flash-Lite in preview — our most cost-efficient and fastest 2.5 model yet. Making 2.5 Flash and 2.5 Pro generally available Thanks to all of your feedback, today we’re releasing stable versions of 2.5 Flash and Pro, so you can build production applications with confidence. Developers like Spline and Rooms and organizations like Snap and SmartBear have already been using the latest versions in-production for the last few weeks. Introducing Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite We’re also introducing a preview of the new Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, our most cost-efficient and fastest 2.5 model yet. You can start building with the preview version now, and we’re looking forward to your feedback. 2.5 Flash Lite has all-around higher quality than 2.0 Flash-Lite on coding, math, science, reasoning and multimodal benchmarks. It excels at high-volume, latency-sensitive tasks like translation and classification, with lower latency than 2.0 Flash-Lite and 2.0 Flash on a broad sample of prompts. It comes with the same capabilities that make Gemini 2.5 helpful, including the ability to turn thinking on at different budgets, connecting to tools like Google Search and code execution, multimodal input, and a 1 million-token context length. See more details about our 2.5 family of models in the latest Gemini technical report . The preview of Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is now available in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, alongside the stable versions of 2.5 Flash and Pro. Both 2.5 Flash and Pro are also accessible in the Gemini app. We’ve also brought custom versions of 2.5 Flash-Lite and Flash to Search. We can’t wait to see what you continue to build with Gemini 2.5.

For 2.5 Flash Preview https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20250616024644&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai.google... $0.15&#x2F;million input text &#x2F; image &#x2F; video $1.00&#x2F;million audio Output: $0.60&#x2F;million non-thinking, $3.50&#x2F;million thinking The new prices for Gemini 2.5 Flash ditch the difference between thinking and non-thinking and are now: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai.google.dev&#x2F;gemini-api&#x2F;docs&#x2F;pricing $0.30&#x2F;million input text &#x2F; image &#x2F; video (2x more) $1.00&#x2F;million audio (same) $2.50&#x2F;million output - significantly more than the old non-thinking price, less than the old thinking price. reply Workaccount2 16 hours ago | parent | next [–] The blog post has more info about the pricing changes https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.googleblog.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;gemini-2-5-thinking-mod... reply jjani 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The real news is that non-thinking output is now 4x more expensive, which they of course carefully avoid mentioning in the blog, only comparing the thinking prices. How cute they are with their phrasing: &gt; $2.50 &#x2F; 1M output tokens (*down from $3.50 output) Which should be &quot;up from $0.60 (non-thinking)&#x2F;down from $3.50 (thinking)&quot; reply amazingamazing 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Is it possible to get non-thinking only now, though? If not, why would that matter, since it&#x27;s irrelevant? reply jjani 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, by setting the thinking budget to 0. Which is very common when a task doesn&#x27;t need thinking. In addition, it&#x27;s also relevant because for the last 3 months people have built things on top of this. reply Workaccount2 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] To be fair, the point of preview models and stable releases is so you know what is stable to build on. reply Aeolun 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The moment you start charging for preview stuff I think you give a tacit agreement that you can expect the price to not increase by a factor of 4. reply woleium 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] that’s a somewhat naïve viewpoint. reply jjani 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Gmail was in beta for what, 2 decades? Did you never use it during that time? They&#x27;ve been using these &quot;Preview&quot; models on their non-technical user facing Gemini app and product for months now. Like, Google themselves has been using them in production, on their main apps. And gemini-1.5-pro is 2 months from depreciation and there was no production alternative. They told everyone to build their stuff on top of it, and then jacked up the price by 4x. Just pointing to some fine print doesn&#x27;t change that. reply amazingamazing 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] interesting - why wouldn&#x27;t you use dynamic thinking? and yeah, sucks when the price changes. reply dcre 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It makes responses much slower with zero benefit for many tasks. Flash with thinking off is very fast. reply drag0s 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] one example where non-thinking matters would be latency-sensitive workflows, for example voice AI. reply jjani 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Correct, though pretty much anything end-user facing is latency-sensitive, voice is a tiny percentage. No one likes waiting, the involvement of an LLM doesn&#x27;t change this from a user PoV. reply eru 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I wonder if you can hide the latency, especially for voice? What I have in mind is to start the voice response with a non-thinking model, say a sentence or two in a fraction of a second. That will take the voice model a few seconds to read out. In that time, you use a thinking model to start working on the next part of the response? In a sense, very similar to how everyone knows to stall in an interview by starting with &#x27;this is a very good question...&#x27;, and using that time to think some more. reply drift_code 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] They seem just rebrand the non-thinking model to flash-lite, so it’s less expensive than before reply jjani 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Not at all. Non-thinking flash is... flash with the thinking budget set to 0 (which you can still run that way, just at 2x input 4x output pricing). Flash-lite is far weaker, unusable for the overwhelming majority of usecases of flash. A quick glance at the benchmark reveals this. reply rvnx 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, so basically their announcement is &quot;good news, we tripled the price, and will deprecate Gemini Flash 2.0 asap&quot; reply mcintyre1994 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The OP says Flash-Lite has thinking and non-thinking, so it’s not that simple. reply aryehof 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; Today we are excited to share updates … They are obviously excited about their price increase reply pama 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] “While we strive to maintain consistent pricing between preview and stable releases to minimize disruption, this is a specific adjustment reflecting Flash’s exceptional value, still offering the best cost-per-intelligence available.” reply cadence- 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Anthropic did the same thing with their Haiku model when they released version 3.5. I hate it. reply pama 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Pricing is a hard problem. Theoretically, if companies occasionally raise prices dramatically once something is useful, they sometimes can create early demand and more testers for future product releases. Ofc they have to be careful to avoid annoying regular users too much. When you sell the harm is limited to late users, but when you rent it is harder to figure out the optimal strategy. reply shock 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Do you work for google? reply irthomasthomas 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] &quot;Soon, AI too cheap to meter&quot; &quot;Meantime, price go up&quot;. reply skybrian 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There are a lot more price drops, though. reply tekno45 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &quot;will be too cheap to meter&quot; means we&#x27;re definitely metering it now. reply victorbjorklund 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Just google. They were behind. So they just dumped their prices to get a foot in the door. Now they are popular and can raise it to market prices. reply sodality2 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I still don’t think there’s any real stickiness to using a Google model over any other model, with things like openrouter. So maybe for brand recognition alone. reply llm_nerd 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Not too long ago Google was a bit of a joke in AI and their offerings were uncompetitive. For a while a lot of their preview&#x2F;beta models had a price of 0.00. They were literally giving it away for free to try to get people to consider their offerings when building solutions. As they&#x27;ve become legitimately competitive they have moved towards the pricing of their competitors. reply tom_m 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] No way. AI pricing is going up because people are willing to pay for it. reply nicce 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] We have likely seen the cheapest prices already. Once we can’t function without them anymore - go as high as you can! reply hirako2000 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] By then comparable or even better models will easily run on edge. So if they crank up the prices we could just switch to local and not get lured by bigger and bigger models, rag, Agentic, MCP driven tech as if all of that couldn&#x27;t run locally either. reply gnatolf 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I am not as optimistic that locally run models will be able to compete anytime soon. And even if, the price to run them means you have to buy the compute&#x2F;gear for a price that is likely equivalent to a lot of &#x27;remote&#x27; tokens reply nicce 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The most meaningful models will run in the future on those trillion dollar data centers that are currently being build. reply eru 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You know that competition is a thing, do you? reply nico 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Hopefully we get more competition and someone willing to undercut the more expensive options reply overfeed 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It&#x27;s more likely the shareholder zeitgeist will soon shift to demanding returns on the ungodly amounts already invested into AI. reply nicce 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Entering the market and being competitive gets more difficult all the time. People want the best and fastest models - can you compete with trillion dollar datacenters? reply eru 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You might be right, but there&#x27;s plenty of deep pocketed companies who are still very excited to compete in this market. reply tonyhart7 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I know they undercutting the price a lot, because at first launch gemini price is not make sense seeing it cheaper than competition (like a lot cheaper) finally we starting to see the real price reply rudedogg 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] A cool 2x+ price increase. And Gemini 2.0 Flash was $0.10&#x2F;$0.40. reply __jl__ 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] 1.5 -&gt; 2.0 was a price increase as well (double, I think, and something like 4x for image input) Now 2.0 -&gt; 2.5 is another hefty price increase. reply jjani 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] 4x price increase over preview output for non-thinking. reply dangoodmanUT 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Good catch, that&#x27;s a pretty notable change considering this was about to be the GOAT of audio-to-audio reply k8sToGo 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] You can also see this difference in open router. But why is there only thinking flash now? reply Tiberium 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It might be a bit confusing, but there&#x27;s no &quot;only thinking flash&quot; - it&#x27;s a single model, and you can turn off thinking if you set thinking budget to 0 in the API request. Previously 2.5 Flash Preview was much cheaper with the thinking budget set to 0, now the price is the same. Of course, with thinking enabled the model will still use far more output tokens than the non-thinking mode. reply hnuser123456 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Apparently, you can make a request to 2.5 flash to not use thinking, but it will still sometimes do it anyways, this has been an issue for months, and hasn&#x27;t been fixed by model updates: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google-gemini&#x2F;cookbook&#x2F;issues&#x2F;722 reply varun_chopra 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] At one point, when they made Gemini Pro free on AI Studio, Gemini was the model of choice for many people, I believe. Somehow it&#x27;s gotten worse since then, and I&#x27;m back to using Claude for serious work. Gemini is like that guy who keeps talking but has no idea what he&#x27;s actually talking about. I still use Gemini for brainstorming, though I take its suggestions with several grains of salt. It&#x27;s also useful for generating prompts that I can then refine and use with Claude. reply therealmarv 16 hours ago | parent | next [–] not according to Aider leaderboard https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aider.chat&#x2F;docs&#x2F;leaderboards&#x2F; I use only the APIs directly with Aider (so no experience with AI Studio). My feeling with Claude is that they still perform good with weak prompts, the &quot;taste&quot; is maybe a little better when the direction is kinda unknown by the prompter. When the direction is known I see Gemini 2.5 Pro (with thinking) on top of Claude with code which does not break. And with o4-mini and o3 I see more &quot;smart&quot; thinking (as if there is a little bit of brain inside these models) at the expense of producing unstable code (Gemini produces more stable code). I see problems with Claude when complexity increases and I would put it behind Gemini and o3 in my personal ranking. So far I had no reason to go back to Claude since o3-mini was released. reply macNchz 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Using all of the popular coding models pretty extensively over the past year, I&#x27;ve been having great success with Gemini 2.5 Pro as far as getting working code the first time, instruction following around architectural decisions, and staying on-task. I use Aider and write mostly Python, JS, and shell scripts. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on the Claude API over time but have switched almost entirely to Gemini. The API itself is also much more reliable. My only complaint about 2.5 Pro is around the inane comments it leaves in the code (&#x2F;&#x2F; Deleted varName here). reply miki123211 9 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] And the error handling. God, does it love to insert random try&#x2F;except statements everywhere. reply ZeWaka 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If you use one of the AI static instructions methods (e.g., .github&#x2F;copilot-instructions.md) and tell it to not leave the useless comments, that seems to solve the issue. reply macNchz 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I&#x27;ve been intending to try some side by side tests with and without a conventions file instructing it not to leave stupid comments—I&#x27;m curious to see if somehow they&#x27;re providing value to the model, e.g. in multi-turn edits. reply luckydata 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] it&#x27;s easier to just make it do a code review with focus on removing unhelpful comments instead of asking it not to do it the first time. I do the cleanup after major rounds of work and that strategy seems to work best for me. reply jjani 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This was not my experience with the earlier preview (03), where its insistence on comment spam was too strong to overcome. Wonder if this adherence improved in the 05 or 06 updates. reply sans_souse 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] can you elaborate on this? reply avereveard 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I&#x27;m using pro for backend and claude for ux work, claude is so much thoughtful about how user interact with software and can usually replicate better the mock up that gpt4o image generator produces, while not being overly fixated on the mockup design itself. My complaint is that it catches python exceptions and don&#x27;t log them by default. reply stavros 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I just spent $35 for Opus to solve a problem with a hardware side-project (I&#x27;m turning an old rotary phone into a meeting handset so I can quit meetings by hanging up, if you must know). It didn&#x27;t solve the problem, it churned and churned and spent a ton of money. I was much more satisfied with o3 and Aider, I haven&#x27;t tried them on this specific problem but I did quite a bit of work on the same project with them last night. I think I&#x27;m being a bit unfair, because what Claude got stuck on seems to be a hard problem, but I don&#x27;t like how they&#x27;ll happily consume all my money trying the same things over and over, and never say &quot;yeah I give up&quot;. reply antgiant 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] For basically that same price you could get one of these :-) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Cell2jack-Cellphone-Adapter-Receive-l... reply stavros 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Where&#x27;s the fun in that?! reply antgiant 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Enjoy yourself!

Can&#x27;t hurt. reply stavros 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Ah, this wasn&#x27;t from the web interface, I was using Claude Code. I don&#x27;t think it has a feedback mechanism. reply hirako2000 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You feelings of a little brain in there, and stable code are unfounded. All these models collapse pretty fast. If not due to context limit, then in their inability to interpret problems. An LLM is just statistical regressions with a llztjora of engineering tricks, mostly NLP to produce an illusion. I don&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s useless. I mean comparing these ever evolving models is like comparing escort staff in NYC vs those in L.A, hard to reach any conclusjon. We are getting fooled. On the price increase, it seems Google was aggressively looking for adoption, Gemini was for a short range of time the best value for money of all the LLMs out there. Adoption likely surged, scaling needs be astronomical, costing Google billions to keep up. The price adjustment could&#x27;ve been expected before they announced it. reply unshavedyak 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Yea, i had similar experiences.

Launch a really strong, capable model (expensive price inference) and once users think it’s SOTA, neuter it so the cost is cheaper and most users won’t notice. The same happened with GPT-3.5. It was so good early on and got worse as OpenAI began to cut costs. I feel like when GPT-4.1 was cloaked as Optimus on Openrouter, it was really good, but once it launched, it also got worse. reply carlos22 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That is the capitalism&#x27; playbook all along.

But they do it for everything all the time. reply theturtletalks 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I disagree with the comparison between LLM behavior and traditional software getting worse. When regular software declines in quality, it’s usually noticeable through UI changes, release notes, or other signals. Companies often don’t bother hiding it, since their users are typically locked into their ecosystem. LLMs, on the other hand, operate under different incentives. It’s in a company’s best interest to initially release the strongest model, top the benchmarks, and then quietly degrade performance over time. Unlike traditional software, LLMs have low switching costs, users can easily jump to a better alternative. That makes it more tempting for companies to conceal model downgrades to prevent user churn. reply jjani 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; When regular software declines in quality, it’s usually noticeable through UI changes, release notes, or other signals. Counterexample: 99% of average Joes have no idea how incredibly enshittified Google Maps has become, to just name one app. These companies intentionally boil the frog very slowly, and most people are incredibly bad at noticing gradual changes (see global warming). Sure, they could know by comparing, but you could also know whether models are changing behind the scenes by having sets of evals. reply theturtletalks 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This is where switching costs matter. Take Google Maps, many people can’t switch to another app. In some areas, it’s the only app with accurate data, so Google can degrade the experience without losing users. We can tell it’s getting worse because of UI changes, slower load times, and more ads. The signs are visible. With LLMs, it’s different. There are no clear cues when quality drops. If responses seem off, users often blame their own prompts. That makes it easier for companies to quietly lower performance. That said, many of us on HN use LLMs mainly for coding, so we can tell when things get worse. Both cases involve the “boiling frog” effect, but with LLMs, users can easily jump to another pot. With traditional software, switching is much harder. reply andybak 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Do you mind explaining how you see this working as a nefarious plot?

What would happen if there was ever some kind of spot market for LLMs? reply thimabi 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] In my experience, Gemini 2.5 Pro really shines in some non-coding use cases such as translation and summarization via Canvas. The gigantic context window and large usage limits help in this regard. I also believe Gemini is much better than ChatGPT in generating deep research reports. Google has an edge in web search and it shows. Gemini’s reports draw on a vast number of sources, thus tend to be more accurate. In general, I even prefer its writing style, and I like the possibility of exporting reports to Google Docs. One thing that I don’t like about Gemini is its UI, which is miles behind the competition. Custom instructions, projects, temporary chats… these things either have no equivalent in Gemini or are underdeveloped. reply hnuser123456 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] If you&#x27;re a power user, you should probably be using Gemini through AI studio rather than the &quot;basic user&quot; version.

I haven&#x27;t had problems with the output limit so far, as I do translations iteratively, over each section of longer texts. What I like the most about translating with Gemini is that its default performance is already good enough, and it can be improved via the one million tokens of the context window. I load to the context my private databases of idiomatic translations, separated by language pairs and subject areas. After doing that, the need for manually reviewing Gemini translations is greatly diminished. reply ttul 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I can throw a pile of NDAs at it and it neatly pulls out relevant stuff from them within a few seconds. The huge context window and excellent needle in a haystack performance is great for this kind of task. reply spmurrayzzz 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The NIAH performance is a misleading indicator for performance on the tasks people really want the long context for. It&#x27;s great as a smoke&#x2F;regression test. If you&#x27;re bad on NIAH, you&#x27;re not gonna do well on the more holistic evals. But the long context eval they used (MRCR) is limited. It&#x27;s multi-needle, so that&#x27;s a start, but its not evaluating long range dependency resolution nor topic modeling, which are the things you actually care about beyond raw retrieval for downstream tasks. Better than nothing, but not great for just throwing a pile of text at it and hoping for the best. Particularly for out-of-distribution token sequences. I do give google some credit though, they didn&#x27;t try to hide how poorly they did on that eval. But there&#x27;s a reason you don&#x27;t see them adding RULER, HELMET, or LongProc to this. The performance is abysmal after ~32k. EDIT: I still love using 2.5 Pro for a ton of different tasks. I just tend to have all my custom agents compress the context aggressively for any long context or long horizon tasks. reply quelladora 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] MRCR does go significantly beyond multi-needle retrieval - that&#x27;s why the performance drops off as a function of context length.

See contextarena.ai and the original paper https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2409.12640 It also seems to match up well with evals like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fiction.live&#x2F;stories&#x2F;Fiction-liveBench-Feb-21-2025&#x2F;o...

Huh. We&#x27;ve not seen this in real-world use. 2.5 pro has been the only model where you can throw a bunch of docs into it, give it a &quot;template&quot; document (report, proposal, etc), even some other-project-example stuff, and tell it to gather all relevant context from each file and produce &quot;template&quot;, and it does surprisingly well. Couldn&#x27;t reproduce this with any other top tier model, at this level of quality. reply spmurrayzzz 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] We&#x27;re a G-suite shop so I set aside a ton of time trying to get 2.5 pro to work for us. I&#x27;m not entirely unhappy with it, its a highly capable model, but the long context implosion significantly limits it for the majority of task domains. We have long context evals using internal data that are leveraged for this (modeled after longproc specifically) and the performance across the board is pretty bad. Task-wise for us, it&#x27;s about as real world as it gets, using production data. Summarization, Q&amp;A, coding, reasoning, etc. But I think this is where the in-distribution vs out-of-distribution distinction really carries weight. If the model has seen more instances of your token sequences in training and thus has more stable semantic representations of them in latent space, it would make sense that it would perform better on average. In my case, the public evals align very closely with performance on internal enterprise data. They both tank pretty hard. Notably, this is true for all models after a certain context cliff. The flagship frontier models predictably do the best. reply extr 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Gemini Flash 2.0 is an absolute workhorse of a model at extremely low cost.

One odd disconnect that still exists in LLM pricing is the fact that providers charge linearly with respect to token consumption, but costs are actually quadratic with an increase in sequence length. At this point, since a lot of models have converged around the same model architecture, inference algorithms, and hardware - the chosen costs are likely due to a historical, statistical analysis of the shape of customer requests.

It’s definitely a notch below Claude 4, but well ahead of ChatGPT 4o, 4.5, o3. reply b0a04gl 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] been testing gemini flash lite. latency is good, responses land under 400ms most times. useful for low-effort rewrites or boilerplate filler. quality isn’t stable though : context drifts after 4-5 turns, especially with anything recursive or structured. tried tagging it into prompt chains but fallback logic ends up too aggressive. good for assist, not for logic, wouldn&#x27;t anchor anything serious on it yet reply DidYaWipe 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] Which are what? reply jjani 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] Classic bait-and-switch to make developers build things on top off models for 2 months, and then raise input price by 2x and output by 4x.

Please ensure you are using a valid model version.&quot; reply simonw 11 hours ago | prev | next [–] I tried using the three new models to transcribe the audio of this morning&#x27;s Gemini Twitter Space. I got very strong results from 2.5 Pro and 2.5 Flash, but 2.5 Flash Lite sadly got stuck in a loop until it ran out of output tokens: Um, like, what did the cows bring to you? Nothing.

Results are coming in great, and it&#x27;s very fast (important for my real-time user perception needs). What kind of rate limits do these new Gemini models have? reply UncleOxidant 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] Are you using Groq Llama 3.3 70b from something like cline? Is it free and what are the API query limits? reply sergiotapia 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I&#x27;m using it from their HTTP API. Limits I can&#x27;t remember what they were initially tbh, I had to reach out through backchannels to get it increased to 300,000 tokens per minute. reply hs86 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] I am always disappointed when I compare the answers to the same queries on 2.5 Pro vs. o4-mini&#x2F;o3. But trying out the same query in AI Studio gives much better results, closer to OpenAI&#x27;s models. What is wrong with 2.5 Pro in the Gemini app? I can&#x27;t believe that the model in their consumer app would produce the same benchmark results as 2.5 Pro in the API or AI Studio. reply thimabi 16 hours ago | parent | next [–] The models in the Gemini app are nerfed in comparison to those in AI Studio: they have less thinking budget, output less tokens, and have various safety filters. There’s certainly a trade-off between using AI Studio for its better performance and using the API or the Gemini app in a way that doesn’t involve Google keeping your data for training purposes. reply mh- 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I don&#x27;t have any inside information, but I&#x27;m sure there are different system prompts used in the Gemini chat interface vs the API. On OpenAI&#x2F;ChatGPT they&#x27;re sometimes dramatically different. reply remus 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] I mean the model names are always a bit odd, but flash-lite is particulary good! reply wayeq 10 hours ago | parent | next [–] kinda sounds like something else reply 2Gkashmiri 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] I have a huge background.js file from a now removed browser extension that the Devs made into a single line.

The workflow is crushingly tedious. And no I don’t want to use an AI IDE or some other tool. I like the UI of Gemini chat and AI Studio and I want them improved. reply andrewstuart 12 hours ago | prev | next [–] Gemini strangely says you cannot upload all sorts of file types. But it accepts them just fine if you upload a zip file……. which you can only do in AI studio. reply nikanj 12 hours ago | prev | next [–] I need an AI model to be able to keep track of the AI model names. reply GaggiX 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] 2.5 Flash Lite seems better at everything compare to 2.0 Flash Lite with the only exception being SimpleQA, so there is probably a small tradeoff on pop culture knowledge for coding, math, science, reasoning and multimodal tasks. reply bigbuppo 17 hours ago | prev [12 more] [flagged] jjtheblunt 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] in a very real sense, Gemini (etc) _are_ fixed search. reply rootnod3 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] If everyone searches through Gemini, then there are no click conversions. Without click conversions there is no incentive for many websites to make new content. Without content there is nothing new to learn for Gemini. It&#x27;s an Ouroboros problem. reply ctoth 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] So you mean only people who want to post something for the fun of posting it will post and we won&#x27;t get as much corporate crap&#x2F;SEO? Darn. Of course practically this means people who post will have a reason to post and that reason might be to influence Gemini, so double darn. reply rootnod3 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I said a majority. Say stack overflow, medium articles, online newspapers, they live off of click conversion. The internet is more than people just posting for fun. Of course everyone only posting for fun would be ideal. But even if you only post for fun, if most people only find your content by seeing it re-hashed by a LLM that hallucinates some other stuff in the middle, I&#x27;d probably also lose the fun in posting for posting sake. reply HotHotLava 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] For me, I actually feel much more motivated to write good and accurate documentation knowing there will be at least one reader who is going to look at it very closely and will attempt to synthesize useful information from it. Same with my old open-source projects, it&#x27;s kinda cool knowing that all the old stuff that nobody would have ever looked at anymore is now part of a humanity-wide corpus of useful knowledge on how to do X with language Y. reply wredcoll 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Stack overflow makes a profit off click conversions. It does not exist because of it. People would have built a version regardless of the profit margin involved. reply rootnod3 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Running the site costs money. So you either run ads or make users pay. Either way, usage of LLMs for searching would decrease the income for these sites. reply jsnider3 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yeah, a lot of the web is at-risk if searchers just read LLM summaries and don&#x27;t click through, but we will have Skynet before that becomes a real issue and then this will all be irrelevant. reply bigbuppo 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Fortunately it was trained on reddit comments. Oh no. reply krembo 17 hours ago | parent | prev [–] Nobody cares about search anymore reply bigbuppo 14 hours ago | root | parent [–] Because it sucked and was filled with SEO spam generated by AI. reply Consider applying for YC's Fall 2025 batch!

For roughly three decades, the JPEG has been the World Wide Web’s primary image format. But it wasn’t the one the Web started with. In fact, the first mainstream graphical browser, NCSA Mosaic, didn’t initially support inline JPEG files— just inline GIFs , along with a couple of other formats forgotten to history . However, the JPEG had many advantages over the format it quickly usurped. aspect_ratio Despite not appearing together right away—the JPEG first appeared in Netscape in 1995, three years after the image standard was officially published—the JPEG and Web browser fit together naturally. JPEG files degraded more gracefully than GIFs, retaining more of the picture’s initial form—and that allowed the format to scale to greater levels of success. While it wasn’t capable of animation, it progressively expanded from something a modem could pokily render to a format that was good enough for high-end professional photography. For the Internet’s purposes, the degradation was the important part. But it wasn’t the only thing that made the JPEG immensely valuable to the digital world. An essential part was that it was a documented standard built by numerous stakeholders. The GIF was a de facto standard. The JPEG was an actual one How important is it that JPEG was a standard? Let me tell you a story. During a 2013 New York Times interview conducted just before he received an award honoring his creation, GIF creator Steve Wilhite stepped into a debate he unwittingly created. Simply put, nobody knew how to pronounce the acronym for the image format he had fostered, the Graphics Interchange Format. He used the moment to attempt to set the record straight—it was pronounced like the peanut butter brand: “It is a soft ‘G,’ pronounced ‘jif.’ End of story,” he said. I posted a quote from Wilhite on my popular Tumblr around that time, a period when the social media site was the center of the GIF universe. And soon afterward, my post got thousands of reblogs—nearly all of them disagreeing with Wilhite. Soon, Wilhite’s quote became a meme . The situation paints how Wilhite, who died in 2022, did not develop his format by committee. He could say it sounded like “JIF” because he built it himself. He was handed the project as a CompuServe employee in 1987; he produced the object, and that was that. The initial document describing how it works? Dead simple . Thirty-eight years later, we’re still using the GIF—but it never rose to the same prevalence of JPEG. The JPEG, which formally emerged about five years later, was very much not that situation. Far from it, in fact—it’s the difference between a de facto standard and an actual one. And that proved essential to its eventual ubiquity. We’re going to degrade the quality of this image throughout this article. At its full image size, it’s 13.7 megabytes. Irina Iriser How the JPEG format came to life Built with input from dozens of stakeholders, the Joint Photographic Experts Group ultimately aimed to create a format that fit everyone’s needs. (Reflecting its committee-led roots, there would be no confusion about the format’s name—an acronym of the organization that designed it.) And when the format was finally unleashed on the world, it was the subject of a book that was more than 600 pages. JPEG: Still Image Data Compression Standard , written by IBM employees and JPEG organization stakeholders William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, describes a landscape of multimedia imagery, held back without a way to balance the need for photorealistic images and immediacy. Standardization, they believed, could fix this. “The problem was not so much the lack of algorithms for image compression (as there is a long history of technical work in this area),” the authors wrote, “but, rather, the lack of a standard algorithm—one which would allow an interchange of images between diverse applications.” And they were absolutely right. For more than 30 years, JPEG has made high-quality, high-resolution photography accessible in operating systems far and wide. Although we no longer need to compress JPEGs to within an inch of their life, having that capability helped enable the modern Internet . As the book notes , Mitchell and Pennebaker were given IBM’s support to follow through this research and work with the JPEG committee, and that support led them to develop many of the JPEG format’s foundational patents. Described in patents filed by Mitchell and Pennebaker in 1988, IBM and other members of the JPEG standards committee, such as AT&amp;T and Canon, were developing ways to use compression to make high-quality images easier to deliver in confined settings. Each member brought their own needs to the process. Canon, obviously, was more focused on printers and photography, while AT&amp;T’s interests were tied to data transmission. Together, the companies left behind a standard that has stood the test of time. All this means, funnily enough, that the first place that a program capable of using JPEG compression appeared was not MacOS or Windows, but OS/2—a fascinating-but-failed graphical operating system created by Pennebaker and Mitchell’s employer, IBM. As early as 1990, OS/2 supported the format through the OS/2 Image Support application. At 50 percent of its initial quality, the image is down to about 2.6 MB. By dropping half of the image’s quality, we brought it down to one-fifth of the original file size. Original image: Irina Iriser What a JPEG does when you heavily compress it The thing that differentiates a JPEG file from a PNG or a GIF is how the data degrades as you compress it. The goal for a JPEG image is to still look like a photo when all is said and done, even if some compression is necessary to make it all work at a reasonable size. That way, you can display something that looks close to the original image in fewer bytes. Or, as Pennebaker and Mitchell put it , “the most effective compression is achieved by approximating the original image (rather than reproducing it exactly).” Central to this is a compression process called discrete cosine transform (DCT), a lossy form of compression encoding heavily used in all sorts of compressed formats, most notably in digital audio and signal processing . Essentially, it delivers a lower-quality product by removing details, while still keeping the heart of the original product through approximation. The stronger the cosine transformation, the more compressed the final result. The algorithm, developed by researchers in the 1970s, essentially takes a grid of data and treats it as if you’re controlling its frequency with a knob. The data rate is controlled like water from a faucet: The more data you want, the higher the setting. DCT allows a trickle of data to still come out in highly compressed situations, even if it means a slightly compromised result. In other words, you may not keep all the data when you compress it, but DCT allows you to keep the heart of it. (See this video for a more technical but still somewhat easy-to-follow description of DCT.) DCT is everywhere. If you have ever seen a streaming video or an online radio stream that degraded in quality because your bandwidth suddenly declined, you’ve witnessed DCT being utilized in real time. A JPEG file doesn’t have to leverage the DCT with just one method, as JPEG: Still Image Data Compression Standard explains : The JPEG standard describes a family of large image compression techniques, rather than a single compression technique. It provides a “tool kit” of compression techniques from which applications can select elements that satisfy their particular requirements. The toolkit has four modes: Sequential DCT, which displays the compressed image in order, like a window shade slowly being rolled down Progressive DCT, which displays the full image in the lowest-resolution format, then adds detail as more information rolls in Sequential lossless, which uses the window-shade format but doesn’t compress the image Hierarchical mode, which combines the prior three modes—so maybe it starts with a progressive mode, then loads DCT compression slowly, but then reaches a lossless final result At the time the JPEG was being created, modems were extremely common. That meant images loaded slowly, making Progressive DCT the most fitting format for the early Internet. Over time, the progressive DCT mode has become less common, as many computers can simply load the sequential DCT in one fell swoop. That same forest, saved at 5 percent quality, now down to about 419 kilobytes. Original image: Irina Iriser When an image is compressed with DCT, the change tends to be less noticeable in busier, more textured areas of the picture, like hair or foliage. Those areas are harder to compress, which means they keep their integrity longer. It tends to be more noticeable, however, with solid colors or in areas where the image sharply changes from one color to another—like text on a page. Ever screenshot a social media post, only for it to look noisy? Congratulations, you just made a JPEG file. Other formats, like PNG, do better with text, because their compression format is intended to be non-lossy. (Side note: PNG’s compression format, DEFLATE, was designed by Phil Katz, who also created the ZIP format. The PNG format uses it in part because it was a license-free compression format. So it turns out the brilliant coder with the sad life story improved the Internet in multiple ways before his untimely passing .) In many ways, the JPEG is one tool in our image-making toolkit. Despite its age and maturity, it remains one of our best options for sharing photos on the Internet. But it is not a tool for every setting—despite the fact that, like a wrench sometimes used as a hammer, we often leverage it that way. Forgent Networks claimed to own the JPEG’s defining algorithm The JPEG format gained popularity in the ’90s for reasons beyond the quality of the format. Patents also played a role: Starting in 1994, the tech company Unisys attempted to bill individual users who relied on GIF files, which used a patent the company owned. This made the free-to-use JPEG more popular. (This situation also led to the creation of the patent-free PNG format.) While the JPEG was standards-based, it could still have faced the same fate as the GIF, thanks to the quirks of the patent system. A few years before the file format came to life, a pair of Compression Labs employees filed a patent application that dealt with the compression of motion graphics. By the time anyone noticed its similarity to JPEG compression, the format was ubiquitous. Our forest, saved at 1 percent quality. This image is only about 239 KB in size, yet it’s still easily recognizable as the same photo. That’s the power of the JPEG. Original image: Irina Iriser Then in 1997, a company named Forgent Networks acquired Compression Labs. The company eventually spotted the patent and began filing lawsuits over it, a series of events it saw as a stroke of good luck. “The patent, in some respects, is a lottery ticket,” Forgent CEO Jay Peterson told CNET in 2005 . “If you told me five years ago that ‘You have the patent for JPEG,’ I wouldn’t have believed it.” While Forgent’s claim of ownership of the JPEG compression algorithm was tenuous, it ultimately saw more success with its legal battles than Unisys did. The company earned more than US $100 million from digital-camera makers before the patent finally ran out of steam around 2007. The company also attempted to extract licensing fees from the PC industry. Eventually, Forgent agreed to a modest $8 million settlement. As the company took an increasingly aggressive approach to its acquired patent, it began to lose battles both in the court of public opinion and in actual courtrooms. Critics pounced on examples of prior art , while courts limited the patent’s use to motion-based uses like video. By 2007, Forgent’s compression patent expired—and its litigation-heavy approach to business went away. That year, the company became Asure Software , which now specializes in payroll and HR solutions. Talk about a reboot. Why the JPEG won’t die The JPEG file format has served us well. It’s been difficult to remove the format from its perch. The JPEG 2000 format, for example, was intended to supplant it by offering more lossless options and better performance. The format is widely used by the Library of Congress and specialized sites like the Internet Archive ; however, it is less popular as an end-user format. See the forest JPEG degrade from its full resolution to 1 percent quality in this GIF. Original image: Irina Iriser Other image technologies have had somewhat more luck getting past the JPEG format. The Google-supported WebP is popular with website developers ( and controversial with end users). Meanwhile, the formats AVIF and HEIC , each developed by standards bodies, have largely outpaced both JPEG and JPEG 2000. Still, the JPEG will be difficult to kill at this juncture. These days, the format is similar to MP3 or ZIP files—two legacy formats too popular and widely used to kill. Other formats that compress the files better and do the same things more efficiently are out there, but it’s difficult to topple a format with a 30-year head start. Shaking off the JPEG is easier said than done. I think most people will be fine to keep it around.

It doesn&#x27;t matter what your shiny new web browser supports, JPEG is considered supported everywhere and all editorials actually refuse to accept anything other than JPEG. You can&#x27;t just break everyone&#x27;s workflow because Google decided to force WebP (for purely selfish reasons, of course). The web browser is actually one of the least important platforms for JPEG. To day JPEG still executes its mission perfectly and with huge bandwidth increases it doesn&#x27;t even matter how large the file is. reply carra 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] We keep hearing different variants of &quot;webp should take over because now it has good browser support&quot;. But that is not nearly enough for an image format to reach widespread adoption. People want to be able to open the images anywhere (what about watching photos in a smartTV? or an old tablet? what about digital picture frames?). They want to edit the images in any program (what about this FOSS editor? what about the many people stuck in pre-subscription Photoshop versions?). They also want to ensure far future access to their precious photos, when formats like JPEG2000 or even WebP might be long gone. I mean, webp was made by Google and we know how many of their heavily promoted creations are dead already... reply jokoon 38 minutes ago | parent | next [–] This reminds me of rust: even if rust will be widespread in 10 or 20 years, it will not really displace C++. Although I need a engineering explanation as to why COBOL is still alive after all those years, because any tech cannot live forever. reply 0points 3 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; COBOL Was popular in the 60s in fintech, so banks, ATM:s and related systems went digital using it. Those systems are still running. reply jagermo 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] i don&#x27;t like working with webp. especially since chrome pushes it on everyting, but googles other tools like slides do not support it. Super annoying, especially since google developed it. reply whyever 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; I mean, webp was made by Google and we know how many of their heavily promoted creations are dead already... I don&#x27;t understand this argument. WebP is an algorithm, not a service. You cannot kill it once it&#x27;s published. reply jacobgkau 55 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] JPEG XL is similarly an algorithm that&#x27;s been published, but Google removed it from their browser and Mozilla followed suit, which effectively killed its usefulness as a web-friendly (and, more generally, usable-anywhere) format. reply Vinnl 41 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Some nuance there — it&#x27;s not dead yet: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mozilla&#x2F;standards-positions&#x2F;pull&#x2F;1064 reply carra 57 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Fair enough. What I meant by this is that, in the end, most software that decides to add webp support is doing it because of the huge push by Google to do so. But if they suddenly change that push to something else then webp might find itself growing more irrelevant. reply imageformatssux 18 hours ago | prev | next [–] How in the world do people store images &#x2F; photos nowadays? Just as there is a clear winner for video - av1 - there seems to be nothing in the way of &quot;this is clearly the future, at least for the next few years&quot; when it comes to encoding images. JPEG is... old, and it shows. The filesizes are a bit bloated, which isn&#x27;t really a huge problem with modern storage, but the quality isn&#x27;t great. JPEG-XL seemed like the next logical step until Google took their toys and killed it despite already having the support in Chrome, which pretty much makes it dead in the water (don&#x27;t you just love monopolies making decisions for you?) HEIC is good, as long as you pinky promise to never ever leave Apple&#x27;s ecosystem, ie HEIC sucks. AVIF seems computationally expensive and the support is pretty spotty - 8bit yuv420 might work, but 10b or yuv444 often doesn&#x27;t. Windows 10 also chokes pretty hard on it. Alternatives like WebP might be good for browsers but are nigh-unworkable on desktops, support is very spotty. PNG is cheap and support is ubiquitous but filesizes become sky-high very quick. So what&#x27;s left? I have a whole bunch of .HEIC photos and I&#x27;d really like if Windows Explorer didn&#x27;t freeze for literal minutes when I open a folder with them. Is jpeg still the only good option? Or is encoding everything in jpeg-xl or avif + praying things get better in the future a reasonable bet? reply OneDeuxTriSeiGo 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] &gt; JPEG-XL seemed like the next logical step until Google took their toys and killed it despite already having the support in Chrome, which pretty much makes it dead in the water (don&#x27;t you just love monopolies making decisions for you?) It&#x27;s worth noting that Firefox is willing to adopt JPEG-XL[1] as soon as the rust implementation[2] is mature And that rust impl is a direct port from the reference C++ implementation[3]. Mac OS and Safari already support JPEG-XL [4]. And recently Windows picked up JPEG-XL support. The only blockers at this point are Firefox, Chromium, and Android. If&#x2F;when Firefox adopts JPEG-XL, we&#x27;ll probably see google follow suit if only out of pressure from downstream Chromium platforms wanting to adopt it to maintain parity. So really if you want to see JPEG-XL get adopted, go throw some engineering hours at the rust implementation [2] to help get it up to feature parity with the reference impl. ----- 1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mozilla&#x2F;standards-positions&#x2F;pull&#x2F;1064 2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;libjxl&#x2F;jxl-rs 3. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;libjxl&#x2F;libjxl 4. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;06&#x2F;07&#x2F;apple_safari_jpeg_xl&#x2F; 5. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.windowslatest.com&#x2F;2025&#x2F;03&#x2F;05&#x2F;turn-on-jpeg-xl-jxl... reply Liquix 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] g**gle is hellbent on killing JPEG-XL support in favor of WebP. assuming they&#x27;ll capitulate to downstream pressure is a stretch. this article [0] sums it up nicely: What this [removal of support for JPEG-XL in Chromium] really translates to is, “We’ve created WebP, a competing standard, and want to kill anything that might genuinely compete with it”. This would also partly explain why they adopted AVIF but not JPEG XL. AVIF wasn’t superior in every way and, as such, didn’t threaten to dethrone WebP. [0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vale.rocks&#x2F;posts&#x2F;jpeg-xl-and-googles-war-against-it reply OneDeuxTriSeiGo 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I&#x27;m not assuming they capitulate under just pressure. Rather I&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;ll capitulate if a majority of or even all of the big third party chromium browsers push for adding it to mainline chromium. This is less just blind pressure but rather the risk that google becomes seen as an untrustworthy custodian of chromium and that downstreams start supporting an alternate upstream outside of google&#x27;s control. Jxl is certainly a hill that google seems intent to stand on but I doubt it&#x27;s one they&#x27;d choose to die on. Doubly so given the ammo it&#x27;d give in the ongoing chrome anti-trust lawsuits. reply frollogaston 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] How is Google so intent on webp winning?

HEIC was developed by the MPEG folks and is an ISO standard, ISO&#x2F;IEC 23008-12:2022: * https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iso.org&#x2F;standard&#x2F;83650.html * https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;High_Efficiency_Image_File_For...

OS support includes Windows 10 v1083, Android 10+, Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 10, Fedora 36. Lots of cameras and smartphones support it as well. There&#x27;s nothing Apple-specific about it. Apple went through the process of licensing H.265, so they got HEIC &#x27;for free&#x27; and use it as the default image format because over JPEG it supports: HDR, &gt;8-bit colour, etc . †Like WebP was similar to an image&#x2F;frame from a VP8 video. reply socalgal2 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; HEIC was developed by the MPEG folks And the MPEG folks were so cool with video, all that licensing BS. Sounds great. No thanks! reply culturestate 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Confusingly, there are two different MPEGs in this context. MPEG the standards group is organized by ISO and IEC, along with JPEG. The one you’re thinking of - MPEG LA, the licensing company - is a patent pool (which has since been subsumed by a different one[1]) that’s unaffiliated with MPEG the standards group. 1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Via-LA reply ralfd 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Arent all MPEG patents expired? reply culturestate 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] No, they’re in a patent pool.

I get that video formats are complex, but complex enough to consist of 5000+ distinct, nontrivial inventions? reply jiggawatts 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; OS support includes Windows 10 v1083 Ba-ha-ha... ha-ha... no. Support is virtually non-existent. Every year or so, I try to use my Windows PC to convert a RAW photo taken with a high-end Nikon mirrorless camera to a proper HDR photo (in any format) and send it to my friends and family that use iDevices. This has been literally impossible for the last decade, and will remain impossible until the heat death of the universe. Read-only support is totally broken in a wide range of apps, including Microsoft-only apps. There are many Windows imaging APIs, and I would be very surprised if more than one gained HEIC support. Which is probably broken. Microsoft will never support an Apple format, and vice versa. Every single new photo or video format in the last 25 years has been pushed by one megacorp, and adoption outside of their own ecosystem is close to zero. JPEG-XL is the only non-megacorp format that is any good any got and got multi-vendor traction, which then turned into &quot;sliding backwards on oiled ice&quot;. (Google removed support from Chromium, which is the end of that sad story.) reply jandrese 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] From what I&#x27;ve seen WebP is probably the strongest contender for a JPEG replacement. It&#x27;s pretty common in the indie game scene for example to re-encode a JPEG game to WebP for better image quality and often a significant (25% or more) savings on installer size.

Not for any legitimate technical reason like, but I often just want to download an image from the web for an image board or drop it in a diagram or ppt or for a joke and nothing works with that format. Nothing. Google image search is useless because of it. Cmd+shift+4 is now the only way to grab an image out of a browser. Which is annoying. It has made my life needlessly more complicated. I wish it would go away. Maybe if browsers auto converted when you dragged ann image out of the browser window I wouldn’t care, but when I see webp… I hate. reply socalgal2 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That&#x27;s true of any new format. Until everything supports it it&#x27;s not so great. iPhone saves .HEIC which I have to convert to something else to be useful. It&#x27;s not everywhere (not sure it ever will be). Windows didn&#x27;t use to show .jpgs in the window explorer. I know becase I wrote a tool to generate thumbnail HTML pages to include on archive CDs of photos. To solve this problem, some format has to &quot;win&quot; and get adopted everywhere. That format could be webp, but it will take 3-10 years before everything supports it. It&#x27;s not just the OS showing it in it&#x27;s file viewer. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s preview app supporting it.

AVIF has not been widely adopted given the difficulty of a leap to a new format in general and the computational cost of encoding AVIF specifically. One of JPEG XL&#x27;s best ideas was incorporating Brunsli, lossless recompression for existing JPEGs (like Dropbox&#x27;s Lepton which I think might&#x27;ve been talked about earlier). It&#x27;s not as much of a space win as a whole new format, but it&#x27;s computationally cheap and much easier to just roll out today . There was even an idea of supporting it as a Content-Encoding, so a right-click and save would get you an OG .jpg avoiding the whole &quot;what the heck is a WebP?&quot; problem. (You might still be able to do something like this in a ServiceWorker, but capped at wasm speeds of course.) Combine it with improved JPEG encoders like mozjpeg and you&#x27;re not in a terrible place. There&#x27;s also work that could potentially be done with deblocking&#x2F;debanding&#x2F;deringing in decoders to stretch the old approach even further. And JXL&#x27;s other modes also had their advantages. VarDCT was still faster than libaom AVIF, and was reasonable in its own way (AVIFs look smoother, JXL tended more to preserve traces of low-contrast detail). There was a progressive mode, which made less sense in AVIF because it was a format for video keyframes first. The lossless mode was the evolution of FUIF and put up good numbers. At this point I have no particular predictions. JPEG never stopped being usable despite a series of more technically sophisticated successors. (MP3 too, though its successors seemed to get better adoption.) Perhaps it means things continue not to change for a while, or at least that I needn&#x27;t rush to move to $other_format or get left behind.

I&#x27;ve done several tests where I lowered the quality settings (and thus, the resulting file size) of JPEG-XL and AVIF encoders over a variety of images. In almost every image, JPEG-XL subjective quality fell faster than AVIF, which seemed mostly OK for web use at similar file sizes. Due to that last fact, I concede that Chrome&#x27;s choice to drop JPEG-XL support is correct. If things change (JPEG-XL becomes more efficient at low file sizes, gains Chrome support), I have lossless PNG originals to re-encode from. reply SAI_Peregrinus 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I store Raw + PSD with edits&#x2F;history + whatever edited output format(s) I used. reply nvch 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] RAW?

Migrating to JPEG XL reduces storage costs because servers can store a single JPEG XL file to serve both JPEG and JPEG XL clients. This provides a smooth transition path from legacy JPEG platforms to the modern JPEG XL. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ds.jpeg.org&#x2F;whitepapers&#x2F;jpeg-xl-whitepaper.pdf If you need more profs, you could transcode a JPEG to JPEG XL and convert against to JPEG. The result image would be BINARY IDENTICAL to the original image. However, perhaps are you talking about an image on JPEG XL, using features only in JPEG XL (24 bit, HDR, etc...) that obviously couldn&#x27;t be converted in a lossless way to a JPEG. reply CorrectHorseBat 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, JPG to JPEG XL and back is lossless, but the reverse is nowhere mentioned. Trying around with some jpg and jxl files I cannot convert jxl losslessly to jpg files even if they are only 8bit. The jxl files transcoded from jpg files show &quot;JPEG bitstream reconstruction data available&quot; with jxlinfo, so I think some extra metadata is stored when going from jpg to jxl to make the lossless transcoding possible. I can imagine not supporting the reverse (which is pretty useless anyway) allowed for more optimizations. reply spider-mario 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; However, perhaps are you talking about an image on JPEG XL, using features only in JPEG XL (24 bit, HDR, etc...) that obviously couldn&#x27;t be converted in a lossless way to a JPEG. A lot of those features (non-8×8 DCTs, Gaborish and EPF filters, XYB) are enabled by default when you compress a non-JPEG image to a lossy JXL. At the moment, you really do need to compress to JPEG first and then transcode that to JXL if you want the JXL→JPEG direction to be lossless. reply gabrielhidasy 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; However, perhaps are you talking about an image on JPEG XL, using features only in JPEG XL (24 bit, HDR, etc...) that obviously couldn&#x27;t be converted in a lossless way to a JPEG.

If we are to extrapolate; the popularity of jpeg, love it or hate it, will invariably necessitate it’s continued compatibility contributing to my pervious statement. That compatibility will invariably lead to plausible hypothetical circumstances where future developers out of laziness, ignorance, or just plain conformity to norms will lead to its choice and use perpetuating the cycle. The tendency as such is that short of a radical mass extension level like event brought about by mass wide spread technological adoption such as what you describe is why I don’t see it going away anytime soon. Not to say it couldn’t happen, I just feel it’s highly improbable because of the contributing human factors. That jpeg gets so many complaints is I feel for two reasons. One, its ubiquity and two, that we actually see it! Some similar situations that don’t get nearly as much attention but are far more pervasive are tcp&#x2F;ip, bash, ntpd, ad nauseam.

It is not the best by far, but everybody supports it, and it is usually not worth saving a few bytes in exchange for worse support, added complexity and extra processing. Lossy compressed images are usually not the most significant consumers of bandwidth and disk space. Videos are. That&#x27;s why there have been a lot more focus on video formats than anything else, there is a lot to gain here, not so much with still images. JPEG-XL is super-complicated because it supports plenty of things most people don&#x27;t really need. Webp is somewhat better supported because it is backed by Google, it is also what is essentially a single frame video, so if you did the hard work on video (where it matters), you get images almost for free, and it saves Google a tiny bit of bandwidth, and &quot;a tiny bit&quot; is huge at Google scale. We are seeing the same thing with audio. MP3 (1991) is still extremely popular, the rest is mostly M4A&#x2F;AAC (2001).

JPEG is lossy, in ways that were initially optimized for photographs. The details it loses are often not details photographs are good at providing in the first place. As the upside for losing some data, it gets to pick the data it gets to compress, and it chooses it in such a way as to minimize the size of the compressed data. PNG is a lossless format. It&#x27;s practically mandatory when you need 100% fidelity, as with icons or other graphics that are intended to have high contrast in small areas. It&#x27;s able to optimize large areas of the same color very well, but suffers when colors change rapidly. It&#x27;s especially unsuitable for photographs, as sensor noise (or film grain, if the source was film) create subtle color variations that are very difficult for it to encode efficiently.

JPEG is lossy - it removes information from the original image, and PNG is lossless. For distribution, like on a website, with JPEG you can compress the image much more than PNG without the users noticing IF the image is photographic. If the JPEG represents a drawing, a screenshot, or contains labels, the lossy compression will be noticeable and PNG is much more appropriate. To keep as master for further modifications and compressions, keeping an image in JPEG format is a bad idea, again because JPEG is lossy.

There&#x27;s no higher fidelity available for normal input images. If file size limits would force palettized PNGs, it&#x27;s quite possible for a JPEG at the same file size to have higher fidelity (since it makes a different set of trade-offs, keeping color resolution but giving up spatial resolution instead); but this isn&#x27;t really a common or particularly valid comparison in the PNG era, was more of an issue when comparing to GIFs. tl;dr: Nope, PNG is perfect. JPEG can approach perfect, but never get there.

You would have to go back at least 20 years to find software that breaks on VBR. Maybe some very very terrible hardware decoder chokes on it? Incidentally, breakage on VBR bitstreams is buggy behaviour, because some lazy developers assumed frame sizes would never change. VBR is completely within spec, and decoders do not have to explicitly support it. Lastly a note on bitrate: 320 kbps CBR (the max allowed in spec) is often wasteful and pointless. In many cases, an encoder will pad out frames to conform to the requested bitrate. Indeed tools exist that will losslessly re-encode a CBR file to VBR by removing the padding, producing a smaller file. MP3 (as good as it is) has certain problem samples that aren&#x27;t fixed by throwing more bits at them. A competent encoder with proper settings, like lame which defaults to -V4 is transparent in most samples to most people. If you disagree you should double-blind test yourself. reply frollogaston 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I&#x27;ll have to check again, but my issue wasn&#x27;t VBR, it was CBR above 128kbit&#x2F;s I believe? 2012 Maserati GranTurismo, which has notoriously not-so-good electronics. reply fastball 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] People that like to own their digital music in the Western World are generally not storing the files in mp3.

[...] the formats AVIF and HEIC, each developed by standards bodies, have largely outpaced [JPEG] I&#x27;m currently sticking to JPEG because, last time I tried, JPEG came out as the best format. Referencing my memory at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chaos.social&#x2F;@luc&#x2F;113615076328300784 - JPEG has two advantages on slow connections: the dimensions are either stored up front so the layout doesn&#x27;t jump, or maybe the renderer is better; and it loads a less-sharp version first and progressively gets sharper - JPEG was way faster when compressing and decompressing - on the particular photo I wanted to optimise in this instance, JPEG was also simply the best quality for a given filesize which really surprised me after 32 years of potential innovation Regarding AVIF, my n=1 experience was that it &quot;makes smooth gradients where jpeg degrades to blotchy pixels, but at decent quality levels, jpeg preserves the grain that makes the photo look real&quot;. Gradients instead of ugliness at really small sizes can be perfect for your use-case, but note that it&#x27;s also ~80 times slower at compression (80s vs. &lt;1s) JpegXL isn&#x27;t widely in browsers yet so I couldn&#x27;t use it &gt; These days, the [JPEG] format is similar to MP3 The difference with mp3 is that Opus is either a bit better or much better, but it&#x27;s always noticeably better. You can save ~half the storage space. For speech (audio books) I use 40kbps, and for music maybe 128kbps which is probably overkill. And I delete the originals without even checking anymore if it really sounds the same, I noticed that I simply can&#x27;t tell the original apart in a blind test, no matter what expensive headset setup I try TFA attributes it to a simple &quot;they were first&quot; advantage, but I think this is why &quot;Why JPEGs still rule the web&quot;: no file format is better than JPEG in the same way as Opus is better than MP3; in that you don&#x27;t have to think about it anymore and it&#x27;s always a win in either filesize or quality That said, Opus is also annoyingly hard to get into people&#x27;s minds, but I&#x27;ve done it and you also see major platforms from compress-once-serve-continuously video (e.g. Youtube) to VoIP (e.g. Whatsapp) switching over for all their audio applications reply userbinator 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] I have written a JPEG, GIF, and PNG decoder.

Google had even added JPEG XL support to Chromium, and then bizarrely removed it (not long before Apple fully supported JXL across all their platforms which invariably would have pushed it over the top), presumably to try to anoint WebP as the successor.

This depends on the system requirements, doesn&#x27;t it? Suppose you&#x27;re compositing a low-safety-impact video stream with (well, under) safety-impacting information in an avionics application, and you&#x27;re currently using a direct GMSL link. There&#x27;s an obvious opportunity to cost-down and weight-down the system by shifting to a lightly compressed stream over an existing shared Ethernet bus, and MJPEG is a reasonable option for this application (as is H.264, and other options -- trade study needed). When considering replacing JPEG with JPEG XL in this implementation, what&#x27;s your plan for providing partitioning between the &quot;extremely high quality&quot; but QM software implementation and the DAL components? Are you going to dedicate a core to avoid timing interference? At that point you&#x27;re spending more silicon than a dedicated JPEG decoder would take. You likely already have an FPGA in the system for doing the compositing itself, but what&#x27;s the area trade-off between an existing &quot;extremely high quality&quot; JPEG XL hardware decoder and the JPEG one that you&#x27;ve been using for decades? I don&#x27;t doubt that in a world where everything is an iPhone (with a token nod to Android), &quot;someone already wrote the code once and it&#x27;s good enough&quot; is sufficient.

JPEG2000 is of the second variety. reply SimplyUnknown 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Multiple reasons, while technically better and more benign compression artifacts, it is computationally more expensive, limited quality improvements, encumbered by patents, poor Metadata format, poor colorspace support...

It&#x27;s &quot;enough&quot; in the best sense of the word and gets its job done. It&#x27;s supported on every device, in every browser, image viewer and whatnot. It. Just. Works. Maybe there are formats that compress better or lossless, but thanks to advancements in disk space and transfer rates (I know, not everywhere but penetration and improvement will happen...) the disadvantages of JPEG can be handled and we can just enjoy a very simple file format. In an era where enshitification lingers around every corner I&#x27;m just happy that I don&#x27;t need to think about whether I have to convert _every digital picture I&#x27;ve ever taken_ into some next-gen format because some license runs out or whatnot. It just works.

What&#x27;s up with that. reply jmyeet 18 hours ago | prev | next [–] So there are two use cases for public image dissemination: 1. Lossy: JPEG fills this role; 2. Lossless: this was GIF but is now PNG; and 3. Animated: GIF. So for a format to replace JPEG, it must bring something to the table for lossy compression. Now that JPEG is patent-free, any new format must be similarly unencumbered. And it&#x27;s a real chicken-and-egg problem in getting support on platforms such that people will start using it. I remember a similar thing happening with Youtube adding VP9 (IIRC) support as an alternate to H264, which required an MPAA patent license. The MPAA also tried to cloud VP9 by saying it infringed on their patents anyway. No idea if that&#x27;s true or not but nobody wants that uncertainty. Anyway, without total support for VP9 (which Apple devices didn&#x27;t have, for example) Youtube would need to double their storage space required for videos by having both codecs. That&#x27;s really hard to justify. Same goes for images. You then need to detect and use a supported image format... or just use JPEG. reply cadamsdotcom 9 hours ago | prev | next [–] “Because it has a 30 year head start.

A funny case in point: Sora.com produces WebP outputs, but you can&#x27;t turn around and use them as inputs. (Maybe they&#x27;ve fixed that?) Smaller websites almost always reject them. Even within big websites, support is fractured within the product surface area. You can&#x27;t use them as Reddit profile icons, for instance. One of the most apparent issues is that a lot of thumbnailing and CDN systems don&#x27;t work natively with WebP, so you have to reject WebP outright until broader support is added. Once the WebPs are in your systems, you have to make sure everything downstream can support them... it&#x27;s infectious. Really unfortunate that we haven&#x27;t been able to move past this. reply martin_a 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You can think about WordPress what you want, but afaik it does not allow to upload WebP files to its media gallery without any additional plugins while being said to run large parts of the internet... reply celsoazevedo 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Just tested on my self-hosted WordPress blog and it works without any plugins.

I guess in these cases, a more parameterized, interactive version would work better, where you can use sliders to adjust some of the angles and lengths used. That should make it much more obvious that it&#x27;s not just an artifact of particular angles used in an example. reply paufernandez 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I&#x27;m the opposite.

I wrote about this about 6 months ago, when I first noticed how LLM usage is pushing a lot of people back towards older programming languages, older frameworks, and more basic designs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nathanpeck.com&#x2F;how-llms-of-today-are-secretly-shapin... To be honest I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean that there is a stifling effect on fresh new DSL&#x27;s and frameworks. It isn&#x27;t an unsolvable problem, particularly now that all the most popular coding agents have MCP support that allows you to bring in custom documentation context. However, there will always be a strong force in LLM&#x27;s pushing users towards the runtimes and frameworks that have the most training data in the LLM. reply crq-yml 10 hours ago | parent | next [–] I think it&#x27;s healthy, because it creates an undercurrent against building a higher abstraction tower. That&#x27;s been a major issue: we make the stack deeper and build more of a &quot;Swiss Army Knife&quot; language because it lets us address something local to us, and in exchange it creates a Conway&#x27;s Law problem for someone else later when they have to decipher generational &quot;lava layers&quot; as the trends of the marketplace shift and one new thing is abandoned for another. The new way would be to build a disposable jig instead of a Swiss Army Knife: The LLM can be prompted into being enough of a DSL that you can stand up some placeholder code with it, supplemented with key elements that need a senior dev&#x27;s touch. The resulting code will look primitive and behave in primitive ways, which at the outset creates a myriad of inconsistency, but is OK for maintenance over the long run: primitive code is easy to &quot;harvest&quot; into abstract code, the reverse is not so simple. reply freedomben 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I think this depends a lot on the stack. for stacks like elixir and Phoenix, imho the extraction layer is about perfect. For anyone in the Java world, however, what you say is absolutely true. Having worked in a number of different stacks, I think that some ecosystems have a huge tolerance for abstraction layers, which is a net negative for them. I would sure hate to see AI decimate something like elixir and Phoenix though reply gopiandcode 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Oh that&#x27;s a great blog post and a very interesting point. Yep, I hadn&#x27;t considered how LLMs would affect frameworks in existing languages, but it makes sense that there&#x27;s a very similar effect of reinforcing the incumbents and stifling innovation. I&#x27;d argue that the problem of solving this effect in DSLs might be a bit harder than for frameworks, because DSLs can have wildly different semantics (imagine for example a logic programming DSL a la prolog, vs a functional DSL a la haskell), so these don&#x27;t fit as nicely into the framework of MCPs maybe. I agree that it&#x27;s not unsolvable though, but it definitely needs more research into. reply NathanKP 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I think there is a lot of overlap between DSL&#x27;s and frameworks, and most frameworks contain some form of DSL in them. What matters most of all is whether the DSL is written in semantically meaningful tokens. Two extremes as examples: Regex is a DSL that is not written in tokens that have inherent semantic meaning. LLM&#x27;s can only understand Regex by virtue of the fact that it has been around for a long time and there are millions of examples for the LLM to work from. And even then LLM&#x27;s still struggle with reading and writing Regex. Tailwind is an example of a DSL is that is very semantically rich. When an LLM sees: `class=&quot;text-3xl font-bold underline&quot;` it pretty much knows what that means out of the box, just like a human does. Basically, a fresh new DSL can succeed much faster if it is closer to Tailwind than it is to Regex. The other side of DSL&#x27;s is that they tend to be concise, and that can actually be a great thing for LLM&#x27;s: more concise, equals less tokens, equals faster coding agents and faster responses from prompts. But too much conciseness (in the manner of Regex), leads to semantically confusing syntax, and then LLM&#x27;s struggle. reply AlotOfReading 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Knowing just what&#x27;s going on in the existing text isn&#x27;t the whole problem in navigating a DSL. You have to be able to predict new things based on the patterns in existing text. Let&#x27;s say you want to generate differently sized text here. An LLM will have ingested lots of text talking about clothing size and tailwind text sizes vaguely follow that pattern. Maybe it generates text-medium as a guess instead of the irregular text-base, or extends the numeric pattern down into text-2xs. reply TimTheTinker 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] &gt; there is a lot of overlap between DSL&#x27;s and frameworks Not just frameworks, but libraries also. Interacting with some of the most expressive libraries is often akin to working with a DSL. In fact, the paradigms of some libraries required such expressiveness that they spawned their own in-language DSLs, like JSX for React, or LINQ expressions in C#. These are arguably the most successful DSLs out there. reply seanmcdirmid 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Embedded DSLs have their own challenge, since the LLM can easily move out of the DSL into the host language in ways that aren’t valid for the eDSL. You really need to narrow the focus with more context to get anything useful out of it in my experience. reply scelerat 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Linguistics and history of language folk: isn&#x27;t there an observed slowdown of evolution of spoken language as the printing press becomes widespread?

The AI agent that is capable of &quot;thinking&quot; in a higher level DSL is able to take shortcuts that let it implement things faster, with fewer tokens. reply Izkata 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; There likely won&#x27;t be one Skynet, but rather multiple AI&#x27;s, produced by various sponsors, starting out as relatively harmless autonomous agents in corporate competition with each other This is kind of how Skynet begins in the TV series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. It takes place after the 2nd movie in an alternate timeline from the 3rd movie (and establishes itself how that&#x27;s possible without contradiction). Specific examples I remember: A chess machine for the brain, traffic light cameras for the eyes and ears, a repurposed factory to build the terminators themselves. The series is about the Connors getting information from the future and going on the offensive to prevent Skynet from forming. reply guywithahat 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] But then we return to the premise of the article, which is that LLM&#x27;s struggle with higher level code that has fewer examples. C is much more repetitive and has millions of examples from decades of use.

Viva la skynet reply furyofantares 11 hours ago | prev | next [–] I notice I am confused. &gt; Suddenly the opportunity cost for a DSL has just doubled: in the land of LLMs, a DSL requires not only the investment of build and design the language and tooling itself, but the end users will have to sacrifice the use of LLMs to generate any code for your DSL. I don&#x27;t think they will. Provide a concise description + examples for your DSL and the LLM will excel at writing within your DSL. Agents even moreso if you can provide errors. I mean, I guess the article kinda goes in that direction. But also authoring DSLs is something LLMs can assist with better than most programming tasks. LLMs are pretty great at producing code that&#x27;s largely just a data pipeline. reply gopiandcode 11 hours ago | parent | next [–] Arguably it really depends on your DSL right? If it has a semantics that already lies close to existing programming languages, then I&#x27;d agree that a few examples might be sufficient, but what if your particular domain doesn&#x27;t match as closely? Examples of domains that might be more challenging to design DSLs for: languages for knitting, non-deterministic languages to represent streaming etc. (i.e https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pldi25.sigplan.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;pldi-2025-papers&#x2F;50&#x2F;Funct... ) My main concern is that LLMs might excel at the mundane tasks, but struggle at the more exciting advances, and so now the activation energy for coming up with advances DSLs is going to increase and as a result, the field might stagnate. reply demosthanos 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Remember that LLMs aren&#x27;t trained on all existing programming languages, they&#x27;re trained on all text on the internet. They encode information about knitting or streaming or whatever other topic you want a DSL for. So it&#x27;s not just a question of the semantics matching existing programming languages, the question is if your semantics are intelligible given the vast array of semantic constructs that are encoded in any part of the model&#x27;s weights. reply daxfohl 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This is somewhat my take too. The way most vibe coding happens right now does create a lot of duplication because it&#x27;s cheap and easy for LLMs to do. But eventually as the things we do with coding assistants become more complex, they&#x27;re not necessarily going to be able to deal with huge swaths of duplicate code any better than humans are. Given their limited context size, having a DSL that allows them to fit more logic into their context with fewer tokens, we could conceivably see the importance of DSLs start to increase rather than decrease. reply neilv 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I was about to paste the same sentence, and say much the same thing in response. To add to that... One limitation of LLM for a new DSL is that the LLM may be less likely to directly plagiarize from open source code. That could be a feature. Another feature could be users doing their own work, and doing a better job of it, instead of &quot;cheating on their homework&quot; with AI slop and plagiarism, whether for school or in the workplace. reply darepublic 13 hours ago | prev | next [–] I recently had to work with the robot framework DSL. Not a fan. I hardly think it&#x27;s any more readable to a business user than imperative code either. Every DSL is another API to learn and usually full of gotchas.

The approach I would take is transpiling from imperative code to a natural language explanation of what is being tested, with configuration around aliases and the like. reply TimTheTinker 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] DSLs are not all created equal. Consider MiniZinc. This DSL is super cool and useful for writing constraint-solving problems once and running them through any number of different backend solvers. A lot of intermediate languages and bytecode (including LLVM itself) are very useful DSLs for representing low-level operations using a well-defined set of primitives. Codegen DSLs are also amazing for some applications, especially for creating custom boilerplate -- write what&#x27;s unique to the scenario at hand in the DSL and have the template-based codegen use the provided data to generate code in the target language. This can be a highly flexible approach, and is just one of several types of language-oriented programming (LOP). reply Lerc 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I think Sturgeon&#x27;s law might be the problem for DSLs. Enabling a proliferation of languages targeted at a specific purpose creates a lot of new things with a 50% chance of the quality being below the median. Using a general purpose language involves selecting (or more usually relying on someone else&#x27;s earlier selection) one of many, that selection process is inherently biased towards the better languages. Put differently, The languages people actually use had people who decided to use them, they picked the best ones. Making something new, you compete against the best, not the average.

It&#x27;s easy to write Python extensions though so that&#x27;s where I ended put basically all of logic that wasn&#x27;t the &quot;business logic&quot; of the tests.

Claude and I vibed ourselves into a corner, and given my ignorance, I gave up on fixing things and declared the software done as-is. I&#x27;m now the proud owner of a tiny monstrosity that I completely depend on - my own local whisper dictation app with a system tray. I&#x27;ve continued to think about stack ossification since. Still feels possible, given my recent frustration trying to use animejs v4 via an LLMs. There&#x27;s a substantial api change between animejs v3 and v4, and no amount of direction or documentation placed in context could stop models from writing against the v3 api. I see two ways out of the ossification attractor. The obvious, passive, way out: frontier models cross a chasm with respect to &#x27;putting aside&#x27; internalized knowledge (from the training data) in favor of in-context directions or some documentation-RAG solutions. I&#x27;m not terribly optimistic here - these models are hip-shooters by nature, and it feels to me that as they get smarter, this reflex feels stronger rather than weaker. Though: Sonnet 4 is generally a better instruction-follower than 3.7, so maybe. The less obvious way out, which I hope someone is working on, is something like massive model-merging based on many cached micro fine-tunes against specific dependency versions, so that each workspace context can call out to modestly customized LLMs (LoRA style) where usage of incorrect versions of your dependencies has specifically been fine-tuned out . reply jo32 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] In the LLM era, building a brand-new DSL feels unnecessary. DSLs used to make sense because they gave you a compact, domain-specific syntax that simple parsers could handle. But modern language models can already read, write, and explain mainstream languages effortlessly, and the tooling around those languages—REPLs, compilers, debuggers, libraries—is miles ahead of anything you’d roll on your own. So rather than inventing yet another mini-language, just leverage a well-established one and let the LLM (plus its mature ecosystem) do the heavy lifting. reply jeroenhd 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] I can&#x27;t even trust an LLM to write working Java code, let alone trust it to convert whatever a DSL is supposed to express into another form.

And if it does come true, consider how the advent of the compiler completely eliminated any incentive to improve the ergonomics or usability of assembly code, which has been and continues to be absolute crap, because who cares? That could be the grim future for high-level languages; this may be the end of the line. reply daxfohl 11 hours ago | parent | next [–] A big difference is that compilers are deterministic, and coders generally don&#x27;t review and patch the generated assembly. There&#x27;s little reason to expect that LLMs will ever function like that. It&#x27;s always going to be a back-and-forth of, &quot;hey LLM code this up&quot;, &quot;no, function f isn&#x27;t quite right; do this instead&quot;, etc. This mimics what you see in, say, Photoshop. You can edit pixels manually, you can use deterministic tools, and you can use AI. If you care about the final result, you&#x27;re probably going to use all three together. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever get to the point where we a-priori present a spec to an LLM and then not even look at the code, i.e. &quot;English as a higher-level coding language&quot;. The reason is, code is simply more concise and explicit than trying to explain the logic in English in totality up-front. For some things where you truly don&#x27;t care about the details and have lots of flexibility, maybe English-as-code could be used like that, similar to image generation from a description. But I expect for most business-related use cases, the world is going to revolve around actual code for a long time. reply seanmcdirmid 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] If LLMs can ever produce implementation and tests opaquely, then perhaps we can instruct at the level of requirements.

Just because you don&#x27;t have the patience for it doesn&#x27;t mean everyone has the same preferences as you do. Anyway, one could argue macros in assembly are part and parcel of the process if you develop things in assembly of significant complexity. If you don&#x27;t like a particular instruction name, you could always relabel it in a macro to something you like. &quot;Redesigning assembly&quot; of an existing target otherwise makes no sense as a concept as assembly languages are usually specified by ISA designers as a target to meet the developers of compilers. You can of course write your own assembler for yourself if you really want. That&#x27;s the beauty of asm, you don&#x27;t have to meet ideological targets for this or that PL school. You just need to admit the right byte codes, and that&#x27;s sufficient.

While writing the blog post, I found myself wondering: will this kind of DSL be easier for LLMs to use than for humans? In an initial experiment, I found that LLMs could translate familiar shell scripting concepts into Hypershell syntax reasonably well. More interestingly, they were able to fix common issues like type mismatches, especially when given light guidance or examples. That’s a big deal, because, like many embedded DSLs, Hypershell produces verbose and noisy compiler errors. Surprisingly, the LLM could often identify the underlying cause hidden in that mess and make the right correction. This opens up a compelling possibility: LLMs could help bridge the usability gap that often prevents embedded DSLs from being more widely adopted. Debuggability is often the Achilles&#x27; heel of such languages, and LLMs seem capable of mitigating that, at least in simple cases. More broadly, I think DSLs are poised to play a much larger role in AI-assisted development. They can be designed to sit closer to natural language while retaining strong domain-specific semantics. And LLMs appear to pick them up quickly, as long as they&#x27;re given the right examples or docs to work with. [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;contextgeneric.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;hypershell-release&#x2F; reply ethan_smith 9 hours ago | parent | next [–] Your experience with Hypershell points to an interesting possibility: LLMs as DSL translators rather than replacements. This could actually democratize DSLs by lowering the learning curve while preserving their domain-specific benefits. The real opportunity might be DSLs optimized for both human semantics and machine translation. reply cpard 5 hours ago | prev | next [–] &gt; Let&#x27;s start with what I see as the biggest problem that the introduction of LLMs is presenting to language design: everything is easier in Python. This is so true. A couple months ago I was trying to use LLMs to come up with code to parse some semi-structured textual data based on a brief description from the user. I didn&#x27;t want to just ask the LLM to extract the information in a structured format as this would make it extremely slow when there&#x27;s a lot data to parse. My idea was, why not ask the LLM to come with a script that does the job. Kind of &quot;compiling&quot; what the user asks into a deterministic piece of code that will also be efficient. The LLM just has to figure out the structure and write some code to exploit it. I also had the bright idea to define a DSL for parsing, instead of asking the LLM to write a python script. A simple DSL for a very specific task should be better than using something like Python in terms of generating correct scripts. I defined the DSL, created the grammar and an interpreter and I started feeding the grammar definition to the LLM when I was prompting it to do the work I needed. The result was underwhelming and also hilarious at some times. When I decided to build a loop and feed the model with the errors and ask to correct the script, I ended up sometimes having the model returning back python scripts, ignoring completely the instructions. As the author said, everything is easier in Python, especially if you are a large language model! reply amterp 12 hours ago | prev | next [–] I&#x27;ve been working on a programming language for about a year which aims to replace Bash for scripting but is far closer to Python. It&#x27;s something I hope to see used by many other people in the future, but a very common objection I hear from people I pitch it to is &quot;yeah but an LLM could just generate me a Python script to do this, sure it might be uglier, twice as long, and not work quite as well, but it saved me from learning a new language and is probably fine &quot;, to which I have lots of counters on why that&#x27;s a flawed argument, but it still demonstrates what I think is an increase in people&#x27;s skepticism towards new languages which will contribute to the stagnation the author is talking about. If you&#x27;re writing a new language, it&#x27;s demotivating to see people&#x27;s receptiveness to something new diminish.

I say this from the perspective of someone who nearly became a PL researcher myself. I could easily have decided to study programming languages for my PhD. Back then I was delighted by learning about cool new languages and language features. But I did didn&#x27;t study PL but rather ML, and then I went into industry and became a programming practitioner, rather than a PL researcher. I don&#x27;t want a custom-designed ML programming language. I want a simple general-purpose language with good libraries that lets me quickly build the things I need to build.

Will the promised productivity gains allow me to recoup the cost of the time spent learning. My usual assessment is &quot;probably not&quot; (although now and then something worthwhile does come along). I think that there is a very real chance that the idea of specialized programming languages will indeed disappear in the LLM era, as well as the need for various &quot;ergonomic&quot; features of general purpose languages that exist only to make it possible to express complex things in fewer lines of code.

This is the approach used by numba for JIT for example. In the end I think mentioning Python is a red herring. You can produce an eDSL in Python that&#x27;s not in LLM training data so difficult for LLMs to grok, and yet still perfectly valid Python. The deeper issue here is that even if you use Python, LLMs are restricting people to use a small subset of what Python is even capable of. reply chr15m 9 hours ago | prev | next [–] It&#x27;s it just me or does the graph of LLM language performance versus training set size show the opposite of what they are saying?

It is unnecessary and aggravating to users, and if we can get away from that I think we would be better off. reply outofpaper 11 hours ago | prev | next [–] Depending on the size of a DSL all the more recent LLMs can be employed to work with them. LoRA&#x2F;Finetuning are a heavier option, followed by RAG, and just setting them up as a big system prompt and caching. And once a model is able to work with a DSL tokens used in valuable code creation can dramatically drop. reply prats226 12 hours ago | prev | next [–] For LLMs, programming languages are basically additional languages that we speak. So how it handles low-resource programming languages is same as how it handles speaking languages with less contribution in training data? DSL&#x27;s would be even harder for LLM&#x27;s to get right in that case compared to the low-resource language itself reply nxobject 8 hours ago | prev | next [–] Replace “DSL” with “languages” in general - the same issues apply. I’m not sure that in a hypothetical timeline where Rust was released today, it would have gotten any traction. reply Mathnerd314 13 hours ago | prev | next [–] Python is just a beautiful, well-designed language - in an era where LLM&#x27;s generate code, it is kind of reassuring that they mostly generate beautiful code and Python has risen to the top. If you look at the graph, Julia and Lua also do incredibly well, despite being a minuscule fraction of the training data. But Python&#x2F;Julia&#x2F;Lua are by no means the most natural languages - what is natural is what people write before the LLM, the stuff that the LLM translates into Python. And it is hard to get a good look at these &quot;raw prompts&quot; as the LLM companies are keeping these datasets closely guarded, but from HumanEval and MBPP+ and YouTube videos of people vibe coding and such, it is clear that it is mostly English prose, with occasional formulas and code snippets thrown in, and also it is not &quot;ugly&quot; text but generally pre-processed through an LLM. So from my perspective the next step is to switch from Python as the source language to prompts as the source language - integrating LLM&#x27;s into the compilation pipeline is a logical step. But, currently, they are too expensive to use consistently, so this is blocked by hardware development economics. reply gopiandcode 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] mhhm yes yes. There&#x27;s a thread of discussion that I didn&#x27;t quite chose to delve into in the post, but there is something interesting to be found in the observation that languages that are close to natural language (Python being famous for being almost executable pseudo-code for a while) being easier for LLMs to generate. Maybe designing new languages to be close to pseudo-code might lead to better results in terms of asking LLMs to generate them? but there&#x27;s also a fear that maybe prose-like syntax might not be the most appropriate for some problem domains. reply jayd16 13 hours ago | prev | next [–] In the same way LLVM is used to forward port low level optimizations to new languages, I wonder if LLMs can interpret new DSLs through the LLVM (or similar) lens and provide value. I suppose this could be done now for all the existing languages that target LLVM and unify the training set across languages. reply jbellis 13 hours ago | prev | next [–] I guess if you love writing DSLs this is an unfortunate development, but for me it&#x27;s more of a glass half full: I can have the AI spit out boilerplate I need to solve a problem instead of spending a week building a one-off DSL compiler. reply mplanchard 12 hours ago | parent | next [–] The benefit of (some) DSLs is that they make invalid states unrepresentable, which isn&#x27;t possible with the entire surface-area of a programming language at your (or the LLM&#x27;s) disposal. reply dack 13 hours ago | prev | next [–] personally i think DSLs could be helpful if they are really good at: 1. explaining the syntax clearly 2. providing a fast checker that provides good error messages 3. prevents errors LLMs seem pretty good at figuring out these things when given a good feedback loop, and if the DSL truly makes complex programs easier to express, then LLMs could benefit from it too. Fewer lines of code can mean less context to write the program and understand it. But it has to be a good DSL and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if many are just not worth it. reply quantadev 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] Since DSLs are necessarily niche, you&#x27;re never going to have much training data in that language to feed into LLM training. Sure this problem can be overcome, but you&#x27;re just creating more work than the time saved by having humans code in DSLs. reply munificent 13 hours ago | prev | next [–] Since I work on a language professionally, I think about this all the time. As someone who loves a wide diversity of actively evolving programming languages, it makes me sad to think those days of innovation may be ending. But I hope that&#x27;s not going to happen. It has always been the case that anyone designing a new language or adding features to an existing one is acutely mindful of what programming language knowledge is already in the heads of their users. The reason so many languages, say, use `;` for statement terminators is not because that syntax is particularly beautiful. It&#x27;s just familiar. At the same time, designers assume that giving users a better way to express something may be worth the cost of asking them to learn and adapt to the new way. In theory, that should be true of LLMs as well. Yes, a new language feature may be hard to get the LLM to auto-complete. But if human users find that feature makes their code easier to read and maintain, they still want to use it. They will, and eventually it will percolate out into the ecosystem to get picked up the next time the LLMs are trained, in the same way that human users learn new language features by stumbling onto it in code in the wild. So I&#x27;d like to believe that we&#x27;ll continue to be able to push languages forward even in a world where a large fraction of code is written by machines. I also hope that LLM training cost goes down and frequency goes up, so that the lag behind what&#x27;s out there in the world and what the LLMs know gets smaller over time. But it&#x27;s definitely possible that instead of that, we&#x27;ll get a feedback loop where human users don&#x27;t know a language feature even exists because the LLMs never generate code using it, and the LLMs never learn the feature exists because humans aren&#x27;t writing it. I have this same fear about, well, basically everything with LLMs: an endless feedback loop where humans get their &quot;information&quot; from LLMs and churn out content which the LLMs train on and the whole world wanders off into a hallucinatory bubble no longer grounded in reality. I don&#x27;t know how to get people and&#x2F;or the LLMs to touch grass to avoid that. I do hope I get to work on making languages great for humans first, and for LLMs second. I&#x27;m way more excited to go to work making something that actual living breathing people use than as input data for a giant soulless matrix of floats. reply rramon 12 hours ago | prev | next [–] Sooner or later languages are going to become 3d diagram to code IDEs where you just zoom in to get to lower levels of detail. reply alganet 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] &gt; a DSL requires not only the investment of build and design the language and tooling itself Not necessarily true. There are two kinds of DSLs: external and internal. An external DSL has its own tooling, parser, etc. The nix language, for example. An internal DSL is like a small parasite that lives inside an existing language, reusing some of its syntax and tools. It&#x27;s almost like intentional pareidolia. Like jQuery, for example. Internal DSLs reduce the cognitive load, and in my opinion, they&#x27;re the best kind of DSL. reply eru 8 hours ago | prev | next [–] I wonder if this will be temporary? As AI systems improve, and especially as they add more &#x27;self-play&#x27; in training, they might become really good at working in any language you can throw at some. (To expand on the self-play aspect: when training you might want to create extra training data by randomly creating new &#x27;fake&#x27; programming languages and letting it solve problems in them. It&#x27;s just another way to add more training data.) In any case, if you use an embedded DSL, like is already commonly done in Haskell, the LLMs should still give you good performance. In some sense, an &#x27;embedded DSL&#x27; is just fancy name for a library in a specific style. reply api 13 hours ago | prev | next [–] One of my big concerns (a little tangential) is that LLMs will have the effect of fixing programming language design and the current language landscape into stone. This could occur in proportion to their use by programmers. The languages that LLMs do the best and have in their training data will be the languages programmers use, and getting any new language into LLM data sets will be very hard. reply keybored 12 hours ago | prev | next [–] Articles in the era of LLMs: assume endless torrent of LLM code generation forever, insert how will this affect X now that we have our foregone conclusion. reply ajross 13 hours ago | prev | next [–] FWIW, the core assertion here isn&#x27;t even LLM-specific. DSL design leans heavily on the idea of an expert author who understands the underlying data model well already. That is no less true in the meatspace world than it is for an AI. DSLs look great if they let you write the code you already know how to write faster. DSLs look like noise to everyone else , including Gemini and Claude. I used to be a big DSL booster in my youth. No longer. Once you need to stop what you&#x27;re doing and figure out your ninth or eleventh oddball syntax, you realize that (as per the article) Everything is Easier in Python. reply quantadev 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] &gt; DSLs look like noise Exactly right. Now that we&#x27;re in the era of LLMs and Coding Agents it&#x27;s never been more clear that DSLs should be avoided; because LLMs cannot reason about them as well as popular languages, and that&#x27;s just a fact. You don&#x27;t need to dig any further, to think about pros and cons, imo. The fewer languages there are in the world (as a general rule) the better off everyone is. We do need a low level language like C++ to exist and a high level one like TypeScript, but we don&#x27;t _need_ multiple of each. The fact that there are already multiple of each is a challenge to be dealt with, and not a goal what we reached on purpose. reply zzo38computer 13 hours ago | prev | next [–] I do not use LLM and I continue to work in the older way. Also, domain-specific stuff can still be useful sometimes, and other stuff involved with designing a programming language. reply bluehatbrit 12 hours ago | parent | next [–] I&#x27;d be interested to hear how you find staying away from them as the years progress. My experience so far is that they write mediocre code which is very often correct, and is relatively easy to review and improve. Of course I work with languages like elixir, python, typescript, and SQL - all of which LLMs are very good at. Without a doubt I&#x27;ve seen a significant increase in the amount of work I can produce. As far as I can tell the defect rate in my work hasn&#x27;t changed. But the way I work has, I&#x27;m now reviewing and refactoring significantly more than before and hand writing a lot less. To be honest, I&#x27;d worry about someone&#x27;s ability to compete in the job market if they resisted for much longer. With the obvious exceptions of spaces where LLMs can&#x27;t be used, or have very poor performance. reply shakna 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] In my experience, its harder to review. It&#x27;ll dump you three classes and a thousand lines of code, where it should use a simple for loop to iterate. The code Claude, Gemini and Cursor produces still is not enough to pass half-decent quality checks. If you&#x27;re in &quot;compile=ship&quot;, sure. If you care about performance, or security, or maintainability, no. It&#x27;s wasting your time, and the review team&#x27;s time. reply quantadev 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] If someone&#x27;s not using LLMs yet in 2025 to write code they&#x27;re basically Amish.

To Proof Maintenance & Beyond! Home Posts Programming Language Design in the Era of LLMs: A Return to Mediocrity? 17 Jun, 2025 &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; programming_languages &#xa0; code &#xa0; llm &#xa0; perspectives The most exciting part of Programming Languages (PL) research for me has always been in Programming Language Design. By carefully crafting a language with a syntax and semantics tailored for a specific domain, PL designers can provide an interface for end users that seamlessly aligns with the sensibilities and intuitions of practitioners, allowing users to focus on the "interesting" parts of a problem and tackle larger and more complex problems. Instead of writing a verbose sequence of API calls to display a dialog to a user in a video game: # example code for a VN character.draw ( "alice" , character.LEFT, 0.1 ) character.draw ( "bob" , character.RIGHT, 0.1 ) character.say ( "alice" , "hello there!" ) character.say ( "bob" , "hi!" ) character.state ( "alice" , "sad" ) character.say ( "alice" , "did you hear the news?" ) A DSL instead allows designers to focus on the high-level of what the conversation should be: # example DSL for dialog [ alice @ left in 0.1, bob @right in 0.1 ] alice: hello there! bob: hi! alice [ sad ] : did you hear the news?... By encoding the "common sense rules" of a domain into the language itself, we can make writing incorrect programs impossible, and eliminate cognitive load and minimise the surface area for bugs and exploits. A DSL for every domain. When you have eliminated all that is incorrect, then whatever remain, however complex, esoteric or convoluted, simply must be correct. This has been a fun, exciting and impactful thread of research for the past several decades, but it would be remiss of me at this point to not mention the "e- LLM -ephant" in the room. It has only been a few years, and LLMs and LLM-generated code has already permeated widely across the software ecosystem and continuously forces developers to reevaluate their preconceptions of what is and isn't possible for a machine to generate. Namely, this also includes problems that we might previously have sought to tackle with language design (eliminating boilerplate, capturing conventions or common sense etc.). This emerging landscape holds a lot of potential, and there are many interesting questions in asking how LLMs can contribute to software development, but as I watch, I am also noticing a worrying trend of LLM developments supplanting advances and interest in the design of DSLs: why craft a DSL that eliminates all boilerplate when an LLM can generate whatever code you need? Is there a future for Language Design in this new era of LLMs? The point of this blog post is to present some thoughts I've been thinking about in this emerging space, prompt for discussion, and outline some potential ways forward language design can co-exist and collaborate with the advances in LLMs. The LLM Problem, or, rather, Everything is Easier in Python Let's start with what I see as the biggest problem that the introduction of LLMs is presenting to language design: everything is easier in Python . That's a little hyperbolic, but what I'm really getting at here is that LLMs have been consistently found to have substantially higher efficiacies when operating in programming languages that are well represented within their training set &#x2013; think languages like Python, Javascript, Typescript etc. For example, the above graph taken from the paper "Knowledge Transfer from High-Resource to Low-Resource Programming Languages for Code LLMs" (2024) shows the performance of one of the LLM models (StarCoderBase-15B) on solving programming tasks in several languages against the proportion of the training data represented by files from that language. The paper presents a technique for improving the performance of these "low-reseource" languages by synthetically generating data, and so the upward lines in this graph represent improvements after fine-tuning using this data, but such transformations have only been applied to smaller models, and certainly nothing at the scale of the production models (ChatGPT, CoPilot, Gemini, Claude etc.) that are the most actively used nowadays. Looking at the original points in this data, the graph plots a bleak picture: as languages become more niche and specific, the performance of these models drops off a cliff and becomes abysmal &#x2014; and bear in mind, even these "low-resource" langauges themselves are in their own right, production, industrial systems with millions of users; just not producing enough code for the LLM to do well on them. If the performance of LLMs drop so sharply even for these general purpose languages, then what can anyone expect from running an LLM on a domain specific language? Suddenly the opportunity cost for a DSL has just doubled : in the land of LLMs, a DSL requires not only the investment of build and design the language and tooling itself, but the end users will have to sacrifice the use of LLMs to generate any code for your DSL. This brings me to my biggest fear moving forward: will DSLs stagnate? Will anyone bother writing DSLs if using a niche language forces them to elide any use of LLMs? or has the barrier to entry to DSL design simply just jumped up, where now developers will have to work extra hard to build DSLs that justify losing the ability to use LLMs with your DSL? Emerging Directions of Language Design in the Land of LLMs Okay, so with the doomer-posting out of the way, in this section I want to take a little bit more of a more optimistic perspective and think about ways in which language design might evolve and adjust to work in cooperation with LLMs. So far, there are three interesting directions that I immediately see for the future, but if you have more I'd love to hear about them! Language Design Direction 1: Teaching LLMs about DSLs (through Python?) Okay, so the problem with using LLMs on DSLs is that, by their very nature, the syntax and semantics of a DSL will differ substantially from general programming languages. This means that without further context, it can be challenging for an LLM to understand what constructs in a DSL mean and how they should be used together to achieve different programming tasks&#x2026; So&#x2026; how about we give them that context? I've seen a trend in recent papers such as Verified Code Transpilation with LLMs (2024) where researchers have had success in generating expressions in niche languages (in this case, logical invariants) by instead asking the LLM to generate expressions in a well-known language (in this case, Python), and manually translating to the obscure language of interest. In the mentioned paper, the authors want to use LLMs to automatically transpile tensor-processing code into different DSLs. In order to ensure that the code is correct, they also ask the LLM to generate invariants that can be used to prove equivalence of both programs: # example invariant from the paper Verified Code Transpilation with LLMs def invariant_outer ( row, col, b, a, out ) : return row &gt;= 0 and row &lt;= len ( b ) and out == matrix_scalar_sub ( 255, matrix_add ( b [ :i ] , a [ :i ] ) The key trick in this paper is the use of Python as an intermediate language, where the authors ask LLMs to generate code in restricted subsets of python first, and then write programs to "lift" these python expressions into their DSLs of choice. In this way, the authors can effectively use LLMs to generate code for bespoke DSLs without having to do expensive fine-tuning steps or retraining the model. Generalising this idea and broadening to the problem of language design in the big, the question I'd like to pose is, can we do this kind of translation automatically? For example, can we create DSL design frameworks that also come with LLM-friendly python descriptions of their semantics? Maybe we can produce frameworks that will test that these python encodings have the same behaviour as the code they model, can we automatically generate the python descriptions from the implementation of the DSL itself? Language Design Direction 2: Bridging Formal and Informal with LLMs in DSLs Taking another stab at the problem, another interesting direction that I see at the intersection of DSLs and LLMs is in investigating new ways of designing DSLs that work with LLM-based coding workflows. Let me start with a brief interlude on how I have been using LLMs in my own work, and how they have changed how I write certain kinds of code &#x2013; namely, scripts. A lot of my programming work on a day-to-day basis involves working on the internals of various verification systems. For these kinds of systems, all the code is pretty complex and intricate, and I really need to write every line myself. In these situations, LLMs really aren't that helpful and any LLM-generated code usually fails to maintain important invariants of the system and use the appropriate APIs. In contrast, scripts, are things that I write fairly infrequently, are usually one of, and something where using LLMs has substantially changed the way in which I write these programs. Here's an example of a prompt that I recently wrote to generate some Python code to do some basic data analysis: write a massively parallel script that iterates through all thy files in afp-versions , runs the function split_file which you pass in the text contents of the file which returns a pandas df with the columns name , start_line , end_line , first_word for each file, record: version (name of immediate subdir under afp-versions that we are in), and project, (the thy files will be under a subdir thys after the verison, so the project is the immediate subdir under that. (extend all rows in the df returned by split_file with these params) iteratively merge all of these files into a single dataframe incrementally and with restarting, and show progress using tqdm, and use threadpool for parallelism Now the description above mostly explains what this code was meant to do, and the LLM generated code did exactly what I needed it to do. Now, the interesting thing about this snippet from a language design perspective is that it generates an "incomplete" program &#x2013; in particular, I don't ask the LLM to generate the function split_file , and instead just give a specification for what its inputs and outputs will be and as relevant to the rest of the task. In a broad sense, when I'm interacting with the LLM for these kinds of scrappy one-off scripts, I'm outlining the high level plan, and asking the LLM to generate the glue code, and then manually implementing the "interesting" part of the problem myself. From a language design perspective, the question that I'd like to pose from these experiences is, how can we incorporate these kinds of workflows into a DSL? Namely, how can we bridge the gap between the formal and informal? My manually written code is in the realm of "formal", and my textual prompt is in the realm of "informal", and in this snippet, I do that by encoding a specification of the formal in the informal as a text component. Can we do this automatically? Can we build DSLs that integrate seamlessly with informal text? Maybe automatically generating the natural language specifications based on the types/analysis that the DSL itself does? Language Design Direction 3: Language Design for Verified LLM Synthesis This is probably the most actively being researched of the directions I've covered in this post so far, but another interesting area for Language Design to move towards following the advent of LLMs is towards the design of specification langauges. So at a high level, since LLMs have been picking up steam, there has been a cottage industry of researchers jumping into the fray of investigating whether we can use verification langauges, such as Dafny or Boogie and so on, to be able to verify the output of LLM-generated code. The first paper I saw in this direction was "Towards AI-Assisted Synthesis of Verified Dafny Methods" (2024), though I'm sure there are now many many more that have been published, and several more in the works. // Example from Towards AI-Assisted Synthesis of Verified Dafny Methods method FindSmallest ( s : array &lt; int &gt; ) returns ( min : int ) requires s.Length &gt; 0 ensures forall i :: 0 &lt;= i &lt; s.Length ==&gt; min &lt;= s [ i ] ensures exists i :: 0 &lt;= i &lt; s.Length &amp;&amp; min == s [ i ] { ... } Instead of just asking the model to generate some code, which may be complex, intricate and contain bugs, the authors suggest instead asking the model to generate programs in verified languages such as Dafny with specifications. This way, users can just look at the specifications to understand what the program does and do not need to understand the LLM code unless the verification fails. 1 From a language design perspective, the interesting questions in this domain consist of asking how we can a) integrate these specifications into DSLs? and b) how we can better design our verification DSLs to capture properties of interest in bespoke domains &#x2013; of course, the properties you care about for a dialog DSL are going to be quite different from one for maybe a packet routing DSL. Can we automatically build specification langauges from the implementation of our language DSL? Conclusion: Language Design for LLMs To conclude this article, I think LLMs pose an interesting problem for the DSL designers &#x2013; the opportunity cost for using niche languages is now substantially increasing, and so we, as language designers, will be held to a higher standard to justify the use of our DSLs. At the same time, they certainly have radically changed the space of what is possible, and also opened up several interesting problems to explore moving forwards. Main takeway, language design and DSLs will have to adjust for this crazy new world we're living in, and if we're not careful, there's a very real chance the space of language design will stagnate, and we'll lose the diversity of fun and interesting DSLs and everyone will just end up writing Python&#x2026; Footnotes 1 Of course, the checking of these programs is not a simple task in itself, and can cause further problems such as slow or brittle proofs. Thankfully, this is a problem that I happen to also be working on ( here ).

I attended a whole course of lectures on compilers (and have a certain fondness for &ldquo; the red dragon book &rdquo; as a result). However, I had never actually written a compiler from start to finish until a rainy day last weekend. Yes, this is what I do for fun. I wanted to make a compiler for a real language, but a simple one so I could complete the project in a few hours. I&rsquo;ve always had a bit of a soft spot for BASIC - it&rsquo;s the first progamming language I learned as a kid. Luckily there&rsquo;s a practical variant called TinyBASIC (thank you, wikipedia, for that tip). My version is even simpler than TinyBASIC (no INPUT statement). Hence I call it toybasic . The code is all available on GitHub . It&rsquo;s written in Go and it generates Go code from BASIC. Demo Example program example/hello.bas 10 PRINT &#34;Hello, world.&#34; 20 LET x = (3 * 2) + 3 30 LET x = x + 1 40 IF x == 10 THEN PRINT &#34;Ten!&#34; 45 PRINT x 50 IF x &gt;= 15 THEN GOTO 70 60 GOTO 30 70 END Example output $ ./toybasic &lt;example/hello.bas $ go run out.go Hello, world. Ten! 10 11 12 13 14 15 Structure My compiler has three stages: Lexer - which converts the sequence of characters in your source code into a sequence of tokens with meaning which can be passed to the&hellip; Parser - builds a tree from the tokens. This gives us a structural representation of the program which is easy to traverse in the next stage. It also checks that the structure of the program provided is syntactically correct and generates helpful error messages if not. Compiler - walks the parsed syntax tree and writes out Go code equivalent to the original BASIC. It&rsquo;s possible to write the lexer and parser entirely by hand, but there are great off the shelf tools available that make this much simpler. The venerable lex and yacc have been helping solve this problem in C since 1975. The original authors of yacc were Mike Lesk and Eric Schmidt - yes that Eric Schmidt. There are a bunch of lex clones available for Go. I decided to use nex to help write my lexer. Nex has an intuitive awk like syntax and a very easy to follow README. Go has a variant of yacc called goyacc built right in to its default tools, so that was the obvious choice to work with for the parser. The parser It&rsquo;s the second step in processing your code, but the parser is the best place to start writing or explaining the compiler because it contains the grammar for toybasic. My grammar was inspired by Bogdan Kravtsov&rsquo;s tinybasic , but I modified it to include strings and removed INPUT . The full grammar is here . Let&rsquo;s take a look at a little excerpt: statement: PRINT expr_list { $$ = opr(PRINT, 1, $2); } | IF expression relop expression THEN statement { $$ = opr(IF, 4, $2, $3, $4, $6); } | GOTO expression { $$ = opr(GOTO, 1, $2); } | LET v &#39;=&#39; expression { $$ = opr(LET, 2, $2, $4); } | END { $$ = opr(END, 0); } ; We define the grammar of the language in a special syntax and give goyacc a little snippet of Go code to run when it parses the relevant symbol in order to generate the parsed tree. Here you can see the part of the grammar which parses all the statements my toy BASIC supports. That opr function is defined in my compiler code to make the right kind and shape of objects for our syntax tree. The net result is that a line of BASIC like: 10 PRINT &#34;Look!&#34;, (2 + 3) * 3 Is parsed out to a tree of objects like: PrintOp | ListOp --------. | | StringOp *Op --------. | | GroupOp INTEGER | InfixOp | | | INTEGER + INTEGER There&rsquo;s also a pretty important little table defined alongside the grammar where you define the attributes that need to be populated for every node in the tree: %union { v string /* Variable */ s string /* String */ num int /* Integer constant */ dec float64 /* Decimal constant */ node Node /* Node in the AST */ }; The lexer nex generates the Go code necessary to tokenize a language using a series of Deterministic Finite Automata. Here&rsquo;s a tiny snippet of the more than 1000 lines of code it generated for toybasic - it&rsquo;s a relief not to have to write this by hand. ... var dfas = []dfa{ // LET {[]bool{false, false, false, true}, []func(rune) int{ // Transitions func(r rune) int { switch r { case 69: return -1 case 76: return 1 case 84: return -1 } return -1 }, ... }, []int{ /* Start-of-input transitions */ -1, -1, -1, -1}, []int{ /* End-of-input transitions */ -1, -1, -1, -1}, nil}, ... Instead, nex takes a config file ( here&rsquo;s mine ) where you specify a set of regular expresions which capture all the keywords and identifiers for your language. Here are a few examples: /PRINT/ {return PRINT} /==/ {return EQ} /[0-9]+/ {lval.num, _ = strconv.Atoi(yylex.Text()); return INTEGER} /[0-9]+\.[0-9]*/ {lval.dec, _ = strconv.ParseFloat(yylex.Text(), 64);return DECIMAL} /&#34;[^&#34;]*&#34;/ {lval.s = yylex.Text(); return STRING} Those are regular expressions on the left between / chars. You provide them in precedence order. This code ends up being very tightly coupled with the yacc grammar. Each regex match runs the Go code in curly braces on the right which must return a token type and fill out the per-type properties for any leaf nodes in the tree. Compiler This is the only piece I needed to write directly in Go. It defines types for each possible node in the syntax tree and each Node type has a Generate function for each of them which knows how to transform that node into Go code (also calling Generate on any relevant children). type Node interface { Generate() } ... type PrintOp struct { expression Node } func (op PrintOp) Generate() { fmt.Fprint(writer, &#34;fmt.Println(&#34;) op.expression.Generate() fmt.Fprintln(writer, &#34;)&#34;) } This is what PrintOp looks like - it simply knows how to write fmt.Println([whatever code my children generate]) in Go! Putting it all together So there we have it - a toy BASIC to Go compiler. To test it out I wrote a little BASIC program that uses every single construct in the language and made sure it works and generates the expected output. While I had a good idea how every step in the process works in the abstract it was elucidating and a tremendous amount of fun to do it for real. Definitely a good way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon. I can now verify that the very first BASIC program I ever wrote still works as expected. 10 PRINT &#34;David is cool&#34; 20 GOTO 10 Contents Demo Structure The parser The lexer Compiler Putting it all together $(window).on('resize scroll',function() { $('video').each(function(e){ var elementTop = $(this).offset().top; var elementBottom = elementTop + $(this).outerHeight(); var viewportTop = $(window).scrollTop(); var viewportBottom = viewportTop + window.document.body.clientHeight; if ((elementBottom > viewportTop && elementTop _ba_track();|3827253649bc182ca952a7de5e4a6018|1750241169

It&#x27;s the easiest part of a compiler to write, by far. It&#x27;s also the least troublesome. It&#x27;s also the most annoying if you&#x27;re writing a new language. You want to iterate on its ideas, but can&#x27;t do so until you have a parser done. I&#x27;ve been designing a few language concepts over the past year, and it feels 80% of this time has been writing and debugging parsers; by the time I get to the meat of language design - the shape of its AST, the semantics of it - any small syntactic change means going back to update the lexer and parser stage. Doesn&#x27;t help that I can&#x27;t settle on a syntax. BTW I first started with PEG, which are nice in theory, but I feel the separation of lexing and parsing stage to very helpful to reduce boilerplate (handling whitespace in PEG is obnoxious). Later, I hand-wrote my parsers (in C), but it&#x27;s gotten so repetitive I&#x27;ve dedicated a weekend to just learning lex&#x2F;yacc (actually flex&#x2F;bison). Even if parsers are easy to write, it&#x27;s good to have higher level tools to reduce the tedium of it. reply thesz 21 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] &gt; You want to iterate on its ideas, but can&#x27;t do so until you have a parser done.

I think the closest modern equivalents might be Python (for easy onramp and scalability from microcontrollers to supercomputers) and JavaScript (for pure ubiquity in every device with a web browser.)

To me it makes no difference whether it generates machine code (one type of language, machine executable), asm (equivalent language but which needs additional preprocessing into machine code), or some other language (which also needs additional preprocessing into machine code, but the tool for this is another compiler). Or it might output Java bytecode or MSIL, which doesn&#x27;t even target a real, physical machine at all. They translate one language into another. The line between compiler&#x2F;transpiler just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. reply orthoxerox 40 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Let&#x27;s put it this way: if a program translates code written in a &quot;smarter&quot; language into code written in a &quot;stupider&quot; language, then it is okay to call it a compiler. If it translates a restricted subset of BASIC into Go, it doesn&#x27;t really do anything beyond replacing one syntax with another. reply tuveson 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This kind of question winds up being the CS equivalent of “is a hotdog a sandwich”. I agree that transpiler is a more accurate term for it and that a hotdog is not a sandwich. But there are lots of languages that start life as compile-to-C things. Many compiled languages today output LLVM IR which is not machine language. Similarly people would probably call javac a compiler, even though it outputs bytecode. reply ethan_smith 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] A compiler is any program that translates from one language to another (source-to-source, source-to-bytecode, or source-to-machine code), so translating BASIC to Go is indeed a proper compiler, just as GCC translating C to LLVM IR before machine code is still a compiler. reply fao_ 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Strictly speaking it&#x27;s a transpiler, but honestly the delta between the target language (Go) and the source language (BASIC) is very fluffy and wooly, from what I remember from my PL theory days the distinction was always fuzzy enough that people used whatever term felt right to them.

That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity. Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, or celebrities, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic. In Submissions Please don't do things to make titles stand out, like using uppercase or exclamation points, or saying how great an article is. It's implicit in submitting something that you think it's important. Please submit the original source. If a post reports on something found on another site, submit the latter. Please don't use HN primarily for promotion. It's ok to post your own stuff part of the time, but the primary use of the site should be for curiosity. If the title includes the name of the site, please take it out, because the site name will be displayed after the link. If the title contains a gratuitous number or number + adjective, we'd appreciate it if you'd crop it. E.g. translate "10 Ways To Do X" to "How To Do X," and "14 Amazing Ys" to "Ys." Exception: when the number is meaningful, e.g. "The 5 Platonic Solids." Otherwise please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait; don't editorialize. If you submit a video or pdf, please warn us by appending [video] or [pdf] to the title. Please don't post on HN to ask or tell us something. Send it to hn@ycombinator.com. Please don't delete and repost. Deletion is for things that shouldn't have been submitted in the first place. Don't solicit upvotes, comments, or submissions. Users should vote and comment when they run across something they personally find interesting&mdash;not for promotion. In Comments Be kind. Don't be snarky. Converse curiously; don't cross-examine. Edit out swipes. Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive. When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. "That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3" can be shortened to "1 + 1 is 2, not 3." Don't be curmudgeonly. Thoughtful criticism is fine, but please don't be rigidly or generically negative. Please don't fulminate. Please don't sneer, including at the rest of the community. Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. Assume good faith. Eschew flamebait. Avoid generic tangents. Omit internet tropes. Please don't post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's work. A good critical comment teaches us something. Please don't use Hacker News for political or ideological battle. It tramples curiosity. Please don't comment on whether someone read an article. "Did you even read the article? It mentions that" can be shortened to "The article mentions that". Please don't pick the most provocative thing in an article or post to complain about in the thread. Find something interesting to respond to instead. Throwaway accounts are ok for sensitive information, but please don't create accounts routinely. HN is a community&mdash;users should have an identity that others can relate to. Please don't use uppercase for emphasis. If you want to emphasize a word or phrase, put *asterisks* around it and it will get italicized. Please don't post insinuations about astroturfing, shilling, brigading, foreign agents, and the like. It degrades discussion and is usually mistaken. If you're worried about abuse, email hn@ycombinator.com and we'll look at the data. Please don't complain that a submission is inappropriate. If a story is spam or off-topic, flag it. Don't feed egregious comments by replying; flag them instead. If you flag, please don't also comment that you did. Please don't complain about tangential annoyances&mdash;e.g. article or website formats, name collisions, or back-button breakage. They're too common to be interesting. Please don't comment about the voting on comments. It never does any good, and it makes boring reading. Please don't post comments saying that HN is turning into Reddit. It's a semi - noob illusion , as old as the hills .|718574ca17526a2037e7ac4fa3cfe2b8|1750241170
https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html|Hacker News FAQ|Hacker News FAQ Hacker News FAQ Are there rules about submissions and comments? https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html How are stories ranked? The basic algorithm divides points by a power of the time since a story was submitted. Comments in threads are ranked the same way. Other factors affecting rank include user flags, anti-abuse software, software which demotes overheated discussions, account or site weighting, and moderator action. How is a user's karma calculated? Roughly, the number of upvotes on their posts minus the number of downvotes. These don't match up exactly. Some votes are dropped by anti-abuse software. Do posts by users with more karma rank higher? No. Why don't I see down arrows? There are no down arrows on stories. They appear on comments after users reach a certain karma threshold, but never on direct replies. What kind of formatting can you use in comments? http://news.ycombinator.com/formatdoc How do I submit a question? Use the submit link in the top bar, and leave the url field blank. How do I submit a poll? http://news.ycombinator.com/newpoll How do I make a link in a text submission? You can't. This is to prevent people from submitting a link with their comments in a privileged position at the top of the page. If you want to submit a link with comments, just submit the link, then add a regular comment. What are Ask HN and Show HN? Ask HN lists questions and other text submissions. Show HN is for sharing your personal work and has special rules . Why hasn't my submission appeared on Ask HN or Show HN? All Ask HNs appear on newest and asknew , and all Show HNs on newest and shownew , but there is a small points threshold before a post makes it to ask or show . What do green usernames mean? Green indicates a new account. Why are some comments faded? Faded text means that a comment has been downvoted. You can read the comment in normal text by clicking on its timestamp to go to its page. What does [flagged] mean? Users flagged the post as breaking the guidelines or otherwise not belonging on HN. Moderators sometimes also add [flagged] (though not usually on submissions), and sometimes turn flags off when they are unfair. How do I flag a comment? Click on its timestamp to go to its page, then click the 'flag' link at the top. There's a small karma threshold before flag links appear. What does [dead] mean? The post was killed by software, user flags, or moderators. Dead posts aren't displayed by default, but you can see them all by turning on 'showdead' in your profile. If you see a [dead] post that shouldn't be dead, you can vouch for it. Click on its timestamp to go to its page, then click 'vouch' at the top. When enough users do this, the post is restored. There's a small karma threshold before vouch links appear. What does [deleted] mean? The author deleted the post, or asked us to. Unlike dead posts, these remain deleted even when showdead is turned on. What do 'hide' links do? They remove a submission from your personal view. Others still see it. Are reposts ok? If a story has not had significant attention in the last year or so, a small number of reposts is ok. Otherwise we bury reposts as duplicates. Please don't delete and repost the same story. Deletion is for things that shouldn't have been submitted in the first place. Are paywalls ok? It's ok to post stories from sites with paywalls that have workarounds. In comments, it's ok to ask how to read an article and to help other users do so. But please don't post complaints about paywalls. Those are off topic . More here . Can I ask people to upvote my submission? No. Users should vote for a story because they personally find it intellectually interesting, not because someone has content to promote. We penalize or ban submissions, accounts, and sites that break this rule, so please don't. Can I ask people to comment on my submission? No, for the same reason. It's also not in your interest: HN readers are sensitive to this and will detect it, flag it, and use unkind words like 'spam'. Can I post a job ad? Please don't post job ads as submissions to HN. A regular "Who Is Hiring?" thread appears on the first weekday of each month (or Jan 2). Most job ads are welcome there. Only an account called whoishiring is allowed to submit the thread itself. This prevents a race to post it first. Another kind of job ad is reserved for YC-funded startups. These appear on the front page, but are not stories: they have no vote arrows, points, or comments. They begin part-way down and fall steadily. Only one is on the front page at a time. The rest are listed at jobs . What's the relationship between YC and HN? Y Combinator owns and funds HN. The HN team is editorially independent . HN gives three features to YC: job ads (see above ) and startup launches get placed on the front page, and YC founder names are displayed to other YC alumni in orange. Are negative stories about YC suppressed on HN? No, we moderate less, not more , when YC or a YC startup is the topic. The good will of the community is worth more than any story. Why can't I post a comment to a thread? Threads are closed to new comments after two weeks, or if the submission has been killed by software, moderators, or user flags. Why is A ranked below B even though A has more points and is newer? You can't derive rank from votes and time alone. See "How are stories ranked?" above. In my profile, what is delay? It gives you time to edit your comments before they appear to others. Set it to the number of minutes you'd like. The maximum is 10. In my profile, what is noprocrast? It's a way to help you prevent yourself from spending too much time on HN. If you turn it on you'll only be allowed to visit the site for maxvisit minutes at a time, with gaps of minaway minutes in between. The defaults are 20 and 180, which would let you view the site for 20 minutes at a time, and then not allow you back in for 3 hours. How do I reset my password? If you have an email address in your profile, you can do that here . If you haven't, email hn@ycombinator.com for help. Can I change my username? Yes. Email hn@ycombinator.com and we'll help. Can I delete my account? We try not to delete entire account histories because that would gut the threads the account had participated in. However, we care about protecting individual users and take care of privacy requests every day, so if we can help, please email hn@ycombinator.com. We don't want anyone to get in trouble from anything they posted to HN. More here . My IP address seems to be banned. How can I unban it? If you request many pages quickly, your IP address might get banned. This self-serve unbanning procedure works most of the time. If not, email hn@ycombinator.com.|81ae1db1c1b9ea07a39da1fb4df140a4|1750241170

Apply Apply to Y Combinator Fall 2025 Batch Apply to Fall 2025 Not ready to apply this batch? Sign up for reminders to apply next batch. Y Combinator is accepting applications for the Fall 2025 Batch funding cycle. The batch will take place from October to November in San Francisco . The deadline to apply on-time is August 4 at 8pm PT; if you apply before the deadline, you will get a decision by September 5 . If you apply after the deadline, we will still consider the application but can't promise exactly when we'll get back to you. About applying to YC If you want to apply, please submit your application online. People who applied before the regular deadline will hear back by September 5 . If you apply after the deadline, we'll still consider the application but can't promise exactly when we'll get back to you. We encourage you to submit your application as soon as you’re ready to apply. If your application is promising, we will invite you to interview with us. Most interviews will be held by video conference in August and September  We typically make decisions the same day as your interview, and we give everyone who interviews detailed feedback on our decision. We invest in companies as soon as they are accepted; we do not wait for the batch to start. About the batch The batch will take place in-person at YC's campus in San Francisco. It starts with a 3-day, in-person kick-off and features weekly meetups in San Francisco. For more information, please read our FAQs . During the batch, we invite eminent people from the startup world to speak. The founders of Airbnb, Stripe, Doordash, and Reddit often come back to tell the inside story of what happened in the early days of their startups. Every company works with a dedicated YC General Partner , who gets to know them well and can help with a wide range of issues.  Every YC general partner is a successful startup founder themselves, has advised hundreds of startups, and works closely with a small group of startups they personally hand-select every batch.  YC companies are in a direct slack channel with their partner and meet weekly during the batch. Similar to how many universities have a house model, each YC batch is actually several small, autonomous groups of companies. You go through YC as part of this small group of companies, have dinner with them each week, and build both personal and professional relationships. Many founders build lifelong friendships with the founders in their group. During and after the batch, we introduce founders to people who can help with any challenge. Often, this means founders of other YC companies . Today, The YC alumni community is one of the most powerful communities in the world, and its members have a strong commitment to help one another. Towards the end of the batch, we help companies raise additional funds by introducing them to YC’s extensive network of investors.   YC doesn't end after 3 months . We continue to help founders for the life of their company, and beyond — and so does the YC alumni community. Read more here . If you have other questions, reach out via email .

We try to respond (with fixes!) as soon as possible, and really appreciate the help. Thanks to the following people who have discovered and responsibly disclosed security holes in Hacker News: 2023-01-02: Carter Sande , Mark Slater , James Darpinian Submission titles were no longer being HTML-escaped in some places. 2022-09-04: Dimitris Triantafyllidis User karma could be increased by exploiting an upvote/unvote bug. 2021-07-04: RyotaK URL tricks could display the wrong domain for some websites. 2021-06-07: Atamyrat Hezretgulyyev A CSRF logout was still possible in some cases. 2021-02-14: Michael Brooks Set the SameSite cookie attribute for better CSRF protection. 2017-04-30: Michael Flaxman The minor version of bcrypt used for passwords was susceptible to a collision in some cases. 2017-04-14: Blake Rand Links in comments were vulnerable to an IDN homograph attack. 2017-03-15: Blake Rand The right-to-left override character could be used to obscure link text in comments. 2017-03-01: Jaikishan Tulswani Logged-in users could bypass 'old password' form field. 2016-02-17: Eric Tjossem Logout and login were vulnerable to CSRF. 2016-01-13: Mert Ta&scedil;&ccedil;i The 'forgot password' link was vulnerable to reflected XSS. 2015-09-07: Sandeep Singh An open redirect was possible by passing a URL with a mixed-case protocol as the goto parameter. 2015-09-04: Manish Bhattacharya The site name display for stories was vulnerable to an IDN homograph attack. 2015-08-27: Chris Marlow Revisions to HN's markup caused an HTML injection regression. 2015-06-24: Stephen Sclafani A form handling bug led to a XSS vulnerability using HTTP parameter pollution . 2015-03-02: Max Bond Information leaked during /r processing allowed an attacker to discover valid profile edit links and the user for which they were valid. goto parameters functioned as open redirects. 2014-11-01: Ovidiu Toader In rare cases some users' profiles (including email addresses and password hashes) were mistakenly published to the Firebase API. More here . 2014-10-27: San Tran Some pages displaying forms were vulnerable to reflected XSS when provided malformed query string arguments. 2014-05-01: Jonathan Rudenberg Some YC internal pages were vulnerable to persistent XSS. 2012-08-01: Louis Lang Redirects were vulnerable to HTTP response splitting via the whence argument. Persistent XSS could be achieved via the X-Forwarded-For header. 2012-07-20: Michael Borohovski Incorrect handling of unauthenticated requests meant anyone could change rsvp status for Demo Day. 2010-01-12: Zain Memon Someone creating a new account could sometimes take an existing username. 2009-06-03: Daniel Fox Franke The state of the PRNG used to generate cookies could be determined from observed outputs. This allowed an attacker to fairly easily determine valid user cookies and compromise accounts. More here . Missing From This List?

Firebase , we're making the public Hacker News data available in near real time. Firebase enables easy access from Android , iOS and the web . Servers aren't left out. If you can use one of the many Firebase client libraries , you really should. The libraries handle networking efficiently and can raise events when things change. Be sure to check them out. Please email api@ycombinator.com if you find any bugs. URI and Versioning We hope to improve the API over time. The changes won't always be backward compatible, so we're going to use versioning. This first iteration will have URIs prefixed with https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/ and is structured as described below. There is currently no rate limit. For versioning purposes, only removal of a non-optional field or alteration of an existing field will be considered incompatible changes. Clients should gracefully handle additional fields they don't expect, and simply ignore them. Design The v0 API is essentially a dump of our in-memory data structures. We know, what works great locally in memory isn't so hot over the network. Many of the awkward things are just the way HN works internally. Want to know the total number of comments on an article? Traverse the tree and count. Want to know the children of an item? Load the item and get their IDs, then load them. The newest page? Starts at item maxid and walks backward, keeping only the top level stories. Same for Ask, Show, etc. I'm not saying this to defend it - It's not the ideal public API, but it's the one we could release in the time we had. While awkward, it's possible to implement most of HN using it. Items Stories, comments, jobs, Ask HNs and even polls are just items. They're identified by their ids, which are unique integers, and live under /v0/item/&lt;id&gt;.json . All items have some of the following properties, with required properties in bold: Field Description id The item's unique id. deleted true if the item is deleted. type The type of item. One of "job", "story", "comment", "poll", or "pollopt". by The username of the item's author. time Creation date of the item, in Unix Time . text The comment, story or poll text. HTML. dead true if the item is dead. parent The comment's parent: either another comment or the relevant story. poll The pollopt's associated poll. kids The ids of the item's comments, in ranked display order. url The URL of the story. score The story's score, or the votes for a pollopt. title The title of the story, poll or job. HTML. parts A list of related pollopts, in display order. descendants In the case of stories or polls, the total comment count.

A written notification of claimed copyright infringement should be faxed or mailed to: Y Combinator Management, LLC 335 Pioneer Way Mountain View, CA 94041 Attn: General Counsel / Copyright Agent Fax: 650-360-3189 To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information: an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest; a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed; a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site, with enough detail that we may find it on the Site; your address, telephone number, and email address; a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law; a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf. Counter-Notice : If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in your User Content, you may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent: your physical or electronic signature; identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled; a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court located within Northern District of California and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Y Combinator will send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion. Repeat Infringer Policy : In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Y Combinator has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at Y Combinator's sole discretion, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. Y Combinator may also at its sole discretion limit access to the Site and/or terminate the registrations of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement. Third Party Websites The Site may provide, or third parties may provide, links or other access to other sites and resources on the Internet or to third party applications. Y Combinator has no control over such sites, resources or applications and Y Combinator is not responsible for and does not endorse such sites, resources or applications.

Any dealings you have with third parties found while using the Site are between you and the third party, and you agree that Y Combinator is not liable for any loss or claim that you may have against any such third party.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine. Disclaimer of Warranties YOUR USE OF THE SITE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.

Y COMBINATOR MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT (I) THE SITE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, (II) THE SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, OR (III) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SITE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SITE OR WITH THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SITE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IF YOU ARE A USER FROM NEW JERSEY, THE ‘DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES’ AND ‘LIMITATION OF LIABILITY’ SECTIONS ABOVE ARE INTENDED TO BE ONLY AS BROAD AS IS PERMITTED UNDER NEW JERSEY LAW.

Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration : PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. a. Agreement to Arbitrate This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Use as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Y Combinator, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Use (including any alleged breach thereof), the Site, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Use, you and Y Combinator are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. b. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief YOU AND Y COMBINATOR AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND Y COMBINATOR AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). c. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution Y Combinator is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user’s satisfaction by emailing us at yclegal@ycombinator.com . If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Y Combinator should be sent to Y Combinator Management, LLC, 335 Pioneer Way, Mountain View, CA 94041 Attention General Counsel (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Y Combinator and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Y Combinator may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Y Combinator or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Y Combinator is entitled. d. Arbitration Procedures Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Use as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Use and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless Y Combinator and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Y Combinator agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. e. Costs of Arbitration Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. f. Confidentiality All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties. g. Severability If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of the Terms of Use will continue to apply. h. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Use to the contrary, Y Combinator agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Site, you may reject any such change by sending Y Combinator written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use). Termination You agree that Y Combinator, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Site and remove and discard any content within the Site, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Y Combinator believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Site, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Y Combinator may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Site, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Site under any provision of this Terms of Use may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Y Combinator may (but has no obligation to) immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Site. Termination of your account or access to any component of the Site will not terminate Y Combinator’s rights to your User Content. Further, you agree that Y Combinator will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Site. User Disputes You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Site and Y Combinator will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Y Combinator reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Site. General These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Y Combinator and govern your use of the Site, superseding any prior agreements between you and Y Combinator with respect to the Site. These Terms of Use will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Y Combinator agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California. The failure of Y Combinator to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Use without the prior written consent of Y Combinator, but Y Combinator may assign or transfer this Terms of Use, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Site may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Use or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Site.

About Wikipedia Disclaimers Search Welcome to Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit . 112,025 active editors 7,010,415 articles in English From today's featured article Ian Carmichael (18 June 1920 – 5 February 2010) was an English actor who had a career that spanned seventy years . Born in Kingston upon Hull , he trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art , but his studies—and the early stages of his career—were curtailed by the Second World War. After initial success in revue and sketch productions, he was cast by the film producers John and Roy Boulting to star in a series of satires , starting with Private's Progress in 1956 through to I'm All Right Jack in 1959. In the mid-1960s he played Bertie Wooster for BBC Television for which he received positive reviews, including from P. G. Wodehouse , the writer who created the character of Wooster. In the early 1970s he played another upper-class literary character, Lord Peter Wimsey , the amateur but talented investigator created by Dorothy L. Sayers . Carmichael was often typecast as an affable but bumbling upper-class innocent, but he retained a disciplined approach to training and rehearsing.

Built in the Ionic order , it is the best-known structure and symbol of pre-Christian Armenia . It has been described as the "easternmost building of the Greco-Roman world " and the only largely preserved Hellenistic building in the former Soviet Union . It is conventionally identified as a pagan temple built by King Tiridates I in the first century AD as a temple to the sun god Mihr ( Mithra ). It collapsed in a 1679 earthquake , but much of its fragments remained on the site. Renewed interest in the 19th century led to excavations in the early and mid-20th century. It was reconstructed in 1969–75, using the anastylosis technique. It is one of the main tourist attractions in Armenia and the central shrine of Hetanism (Armenian neopaganism). This aerial photograph shows the Garni Temple in the winter.

Born in Kingston upon Hull , he trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art , but his studies—and the early stages of his career—were curtailed by the Second World War. After initial success in revue and sketch productions, he was cast by the film producers John and Roy Boulting to star in a series of satires , starting with Private's Progress in 1956 through to I'm All Right Jack in 1959. In the mid-1960s he played Bertie Wooster for BBC Television for which he received positive reviews, including from P.&#160;G. Wodehouse , the writer who created the character of Wooster. In the early 1970s he played another upper-class literary character, Lord Peter Wimsey , the amateur but talented investigator created by Dorothy L. Sayers . Carmichael was often typecast as an affable but bumbling upper-class innocent, but he retained a disciplined approach to training and rehearsing.

Built in the Ionic order , it is the best-known structure and symbol of pre-Christian Armenia . It has been described as the "easternmost building of the Greco-Roman world " and the only largely preserved Hellenistic building in the former Soviet Union . It is conventionally identified as a pagan temple built by King Tiridates&#160;I in the first century AD as a temple to the sun god Mihr ( Mithra ). It collapsed in a 1679 earthquake , but much of its fragments remained on the site. Renewed interest in the 19th century led to excavations in the early and mid-20th century. It was reconstructed in 1969–75, using the anastylosis technique. It is one of the main tourist attractions in Armenia and the central shrine of Hetanism (Armenian neopaganism). This aerial photograph shows the Garni Temple in the winter.

For aspiring contributors, also see this guide and tutorial . For other uses, see Wikipedia:Wikipedia (disambiguation) . "Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing." — Jimmy Wales Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and millions already have . Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by presenting information on all branches of knowledge . Hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation , Wikipedia consists of freely editable content, with articles that usually contain numerous links guiding readers to more information. Written collaboratively by volunteers known as Wikipedians , Wikipedia articles can be edited by anyone with Internet access , except in limited cases in which editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism . Since its creation on January 15, 2001 , it has grown into the world's largest reference website , attracting over a billion visitors each month . Wikipedia currently has more than sixty-five million articles in more than 300 languages , including 7,010,410 articles in English , with 112,025 active contributors in the past month. Wikipedia's fundamental principles are summarized in its five pillars . While the Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines , new editors do not need to be familiar with them before they start contributing. Anyone can edit Wikipedia's text, data, references, and images. The quality of content is more important than the expertise of who contributes it. Wikipedia's content must conform with its policies , including being verifiable by published reliable sources . Contributions based on personal opinions , beliefs, or personal experiences, unreviewed research , libellous material, and copyright violations are not allowed, and will not remain. Wikipedia's software makes it easy to reverse errors, and experienced editors watch and patrol bad edits. Wikipedia differs from printed references in important ways . Anyone can instantly improve it, add quality information, remove misinformation, and fix errors and vandalism . Since Wikipedia is continually updated, encyclopedic articles on major news events appear within minutes. For over 24 years, editors have volunteered their time and talents to create history's most comprehensive encyclopedia while providing references and other resources to researchers worldwide (see Researching with Wikipedia ). In summary, Wikipedia has tested the wisdom of the crowd since 2001 and has found that it succeeds. To start editing simply click the Edit or Edit&nbsp;source &nbsp; button, or the pencil icon &nbsp; , at the top of any non-protected Wikipedia page or section. v t e Basic information on Wikipedia - ( Search ) Help directory menu Teahouse (interactive help for new editors) About Wikipedia Readers' index to Wikipedia Statistics Administration FAQs Purpose Who writes Wikipedia?

This wizard will guide you through a questionnaire prompting you for the appropriate copyright and sourcing information for each file. Please ensure you understand copyright and the image use policy before proceeding. Upload your own or a freely licensed file Uploads to Wikimedia Commons Upload a non-free file Uploads locally to the English Wikipedia; must comply with the non-free content criteria You do not have JavaScript enabled Sorry, in order to use this uploading script, JavaScript must be enabled. You can still use the plain Special:Upload page to upload files to the English Wikipedia without JavaScript. You are not currently logged in. Sorry, in order to use this uploading script and to upload files, you need to be logged in with your named account. Please log in and then try again. Your account has not become confirmed yet. Sorry, in order to upload files on the English Wikipedia, you need to have a confirmed account . Normally, your account will become confirmed automatically once you have made 10 edits and four days have passed since you created it. You may already be able to upload files on the Wikimedia Commons , but you can't do it on the English Wikipedia just yet. If the file you want to upload has a free license, please go to Commons and upload it there. Important note: if you don't want to wait until you are autoconfirmed, you may ask somebody else to upload a file for you at Wikipedia:Files for upload . In very rare cases an administrator may make your account confirmed manually through a request at Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Confirmed . Step 1: Choose your file File: Choose a file from your computer. Maximum file size: 100 MB. Permitted file types: png, gif, jpg, jpeg, xcf, pdf, mid, mp3, mpeg, mpg, ogg, ogv, opus, svg, djvu, tiff, tif, oga, flac, wav, wave, webm, webp. Step 2: Describe your file Please provide a clear, descriptive name by which your file will be known on Wikipedia. &nbsp; This name must be unique across the whole of Wikipedia, so please make it informative and easy to recognize. It's no problem to use a fairly long name. It may also include spaces, commas and most other punctuation marks. Please also note that file names are case sensitive (with the exception of the first letter). Good: "City of London, skyline from London City Hall, Oct 2008.jpg". Bad : "Skyline.jpg", "DSC0001234.jpg". Sorry, a few special characters and character combinations cannot be used in the filename for technical reasons. This goes especially for #&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;[&nbsp;]&nbsp;|&nbsp;:&nbsp;{&nbsp;}&nbsp;/&nbsp; and ~~~ . Your filename has been modified to avoid these. Please check if it is okay now. The filename you chose seems to be very short, or overly generic. Please don't use: Titles that consist only of very generic descriptive words (e.g. "Sunset.jpg", "Townhall.jpg") Titles that consist only of a person's first or last name, when that name is likely to be shared by many others (e.g. "John.jpg", "Miller.jpg") Titles that consist of mere numbers, of the kind often produced by digital cameras ("DSC_001234", "IMGP0345"), or random strings like those sometimes found on the web ("30996951316264l.jpg") Existing file . Last uploaded by Example user . A file of this name already exists on Commons! If you upload your file with this name, you will be masking the existing file and make it inaccessible. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. This should not be done, except in very rare exceptional cases. Please don't upload your file under this name, unless you seriously know what you are doing. Choose a different name for your new file instead. If you want to replace the existing file with an uncontroversial, improved version of the same work, please go to Commons and upload it there, not here on the English Wikipedia's local wiki. A file of this name already exists. If you upload your file with this name, you will be overwriting the existing file. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. Please don't do this, unless you have a good reason to: No , I don't want to overwrite the existing file. I will choose a different name for my new file instead. Yes , I want to overwrite the existing file. My file is merely a new, improved and uncontentious version of the same work. The old description page, including the source and copyright information, will still be correct for the new version and can remain the same. Yes , I want to overwrite the existing file, and I will use this wizard to add a new description and new source information for it. The previous version was my own, or else I have made sure the previous uploader(s) don't object to this replacement. Please provide a brief description of the contents of this file. This will be stored and displayed as part of the file description page. It is important that other editors are able to understand what this file is about. &nbsp; What does this file show? What is it a photo/diagram/recording of? It will be helpful if you also add a wikilink to the article where you want to use it. Step 3: Provide source and copyright information It is very important that you read through the following options and questions, and provide all required information truthfully and carefully. This is a free work. I can demonstrate that it is legally okay for anybody to use, in Wikipedia and elsewhere, for any purpose. Thank you for offering to upload a free work. Wikipedia loves free files. However, we would love it even more if you uploaded them on our sister project, Wikimedia Commons . Files uploaded on Commons can be used immediately here on Wikipedia as well as on all its sister projects. Uploading files on Commons works just the same as here. Your Wikipedia account will automatically work on Commons too. Please consider uploading your file on Commons . However, if you prefer to do it here instead, you may go ahead with this form. You can also first use this form to collect the information about your file and then send it to Commons from here. Copyright status: This file is entirely my own work. I am the copyright holder. I made this myself, from scratch, without copying or incorporating anybody else's creative work, and I am willing to release it under a free license. Please note that by "entirely self-made" we really mean just that. Do not use this section for any of the following: a scan or photograph you made of a painting, drawing, printed page or other item originally created by somebody else. The copyright belongs to the original creator, not to you. a screenshot or other kind of capture of a video, computer screen, TV programme or other kind of visual media. a picture you created by modifying or copying some other picture or by combining several preexisting pictures made by somebody else. a picture given to you by somebody else. a picture you found somewhere on the Internet. Editors who falsely declare such items as their "own work" will be blocked from editing . Please describe how and when you created this item. How? &nbsp; (e.g.: Where and on what kind of occasion did you take this photo? How did you make this diagram? etc.) Date &nbsp; (please use YYYY-MM-DD format if possible). Publication: Please indicate here if you have previously published this item elsewhere, e.g. on your own website, your Flickr or Facebook account, etc., providing a link. It is important that you place this work under a free license, which will allow everybody else to use it for any purpose, including both commercial and non-commercial purposes, and to modify it. This license will be irrevocable. This file was given to me by its owner. The copyright owner of this file has given it to me for uploading on Wikipedia. I can provide evidence that they have agreed to release it under a free license, for free use by anybody and for any purpose. Please describe who owns this work and how you got it from them. Owner/author: Date of creation: Source: Where did you get the file from? (e.g. available online; was sent to me personally …) Permission: How did you receive the permission? (e.g.: by e-mail, personally, I work for the owner …) The copyright owner has chosen the following license: License: Other: Evidence: The license statement can be found online at: The license agreement has been forwarded to Wikimedia's volunteer response team at "permissions-en@wikimedia.org". OTRS ticket received: The license hasn't yet been forwarded, but I will do so shortly or ask the owner to send it. I haven't got the evidence right now, but I will provide some if requested to do so. Note: files without verifiable permissions may be deleted. You may be better off obtaining proof of permission first. This file is from a free published source. I took it from a website or other published source, where its author has explicitly placed it under a free license, allowing free re-use by anybody. Use this only if there is an explicit licensing statement in the source. The website must explicitly say that the image is released under a license that allows free re-use for any purpose, e.g. the Creative Commons Attribution license. You must be able to point exactly to where it says this. If the source website doesn't say so explicitly, please do not upload the file . Author/owner: Date of creation: Source: For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found ("http://... .html"), not a direct link to the image file itself ("http://... .jpg"). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) The copyright owner has chosen the following license for this file: License: Other: Evidence: Provide a link to where the author explicitly says that the file is released under a free license. (if not visible on the source page itself). This work is so old its copyright has expired This is an old photograph, or a photographic reproduction of an old painting, drawing, etc. I can provide enough information about its author and provenance to prove that it is old enough for its copyright to have expired. It is now legally in the Public Domain . Original author: Please name the original author of this work. Lifetime: Specify date of death, if applicable to public domain status. In many cases, we need to be certain the author died before a certain year, in many cases before 1930. Original publication: Provide as much information as possible about the original time and place of publication of this work. For print publications: provide full bibliographic information. Date of publication: Provide date of first publication, and date of creation if different. Immediate source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found ("http://... .html"), not a direct link to the image file itself ("http://... .jpg"). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Public Domain status: This work is free of all copyrights because: It was created and first published before 1930 and is therefore in the Public Domain in the US. It was first published outside the US , and it was in the Public Domain in its country of origin by the " URAA date ". For most countries, this means the author died 70 years before 1 January 1996, i.e. before 1926. Please look up the copyright rules for the specific country at [1] . It was first published in the US before 1989 , and its copyright expired because it was published without a copyright notice and/or without the necessary copyright registration. Please look up the exact rules at [2] . Its copyright expired for some other reason. [Please explain below]. Explanation: Please provide any evidence necessary to verify the public domain status. This file is in the Public Domain for some other reason. I can demonstrate that this work is legally in the Public Domain, i.e. nobody owns any copyrights on it. This may be for a variety of reasons, for instance because it was created by the US Federal Government, or because it is too simple to attract any copyright. Public Domain means that nobody owns any copyrights on this work. It does not mean simply that it is freely viewable somewhere on the web or that it has been widely used by others. This is not for images you simply found somewhere on the web. Most images on the web are under copyright and belong to somebody, even if you believe the owner won't care about that copyright. If it is in the public domain, you must be able to point to an actual law that makes it so. If you can't point to such a law but merely found this image somewhere, then please do not upload it. Author: Please name the original author of this work. Source: State exactly where you found this file. For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found ("http://... .html"), not a direct link to the image file itself ("http://... .jpg"). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) Date of creation: Public Domain status: This work is free of all copyrights because: It was created by an agency of the US Federal Government. This does not apply to most US state and local agencies , nor to governments of other countries! It is an official governmental item, such as a flag, state emblem, banknote or postage stamp, from a country where such items are exempt from copyright according to local law. This does not apply to all countries, nor does it usually apply to all publications! (For instance, it usually doesn't apply to simple publicity photographs published on a governmental website.) Please look up the copyright rules for the specific country in question. If the country does not have an exemption rule that applies to this item, go on with the section for " non-free copyrighted works " below. Explanation: Add any explanation or evidence necessary to substantiate your statement above. Cite and provide a link to the relevant law if possible. It is too simple to be eligible for copyright. This typically applies only to graphics that consist solely of simple geometric shapes and/or a few letters or words, or to items such as mathematical or chemical formulae. It may apply to some very simple logos that do not contain complex pictorial elements. It never applies to photographs! It is in the Public Domain for some other reason. Explanation: This is a copyrighted, non-free work, but I believe it is Fair Use. I have read the Wikipedia rules on Non-Free Content , and I am prepared to explain how the use of this file will meet the criteria set out there. Please remember that you will need to demonstrate that: The file will serve an important function in a particular article; ( NFCC8 ) It cannot be replaced by any other, free illustration that might yet be created; ( NFCC1 ) Its use does not negatively affect the commercial interests of its owner ( NFCC2 ) There will not be more non-free material used than necessary. ( NFCC3 ) This file will be used in the following article: Enter the name of exactly one Wikipedia article, without the [[...]] brackets and without the "http://en.wikipedia.org/..." URL code. It has to be an actual article, not a talkpage, template, user page, etc. If you plan to use the file in more than one article, please name only one of them here. Then, after uploading, open the image description page for editing and add your separate explanations for each additional article manually. Example – article okay. This article doesn't exist! The article Example could not be found. Please check the spelling, and make sure you enter the name of an existing article in which you will include this file. If this is an article you are only planning to write, please write it first and upload the file afterwards. This is not an actual encyclopedia article! The page Example is not in the main article namespace. Non-free files can only be used in mainspace article pages, not on a user page, talk page, template, etc. Please upload this file only if it is going to be used in an actual article. If this page is an article draft in your user space, we're sorry, but we must ask you to wait until the page is ready and has been moved into mainspace, and only upload the file after that. This is a disambiguation page! The page Example is not a real article, but a disambiguation page pointing to a number of other pages. Please check and enter the exact title of the actual target article you meant. Non-free use rationale This image is the object of discussion in an article.

Even if it is merely possible that a replacement could be created, we will not use the non-free file. Please explain why you are confident that our use of the file will not harm any commercial opportunities of its owner. &nbsp; We will typically not use a file if its owner has a potential commercial interest in its use, and if our use of it would compete with its original market role. Remember that the use of non-free files must be minimal. This can mean several things: Don't use more files per article/topic than necessary Don't use the same file in more articles than necessary Don't use larger excerpts of a single work than necessary Don't use images of higher resolution than necessary In view of this, please explain how the use of this file will be minimal. &nbsp; Special source and license conditions (optional) &nbsp; Any further relevant information about this file? &nbsp; Edit summary: A brief description of why you are overwriting this file. This will not be saved on the description page, but will be shown in its edit history. Yes , I want this file to be immediately available in all Wikimedia projects, in all languages. I will upload it on the Wikimedia Commons . Clicking this button will redirect you to a page on Commons. This will only work if you are already logged in there, which is likely the case if you have a unified account . Check here to see if you are logged in. No , I want to upload this file locally. This way it can be used only on the English Wikipedia. We urge you to upload it to the Commons unless there is a very good reason for it to stay local.

( edit | history ) How to add to the community bulletin board The community bulletin board has 2 sections that can be used by Wikipedians for announcements: "Events and projects" and "WikiProject notices". In general, keep it concise (under 2 lines), refrain from fancy formatting , and new entries should be placed at the top of their section. Before editing, make sure you are on Wikipedia:Community bulletin board , not Wikipedia:Community portal , where the board is transcluded. Events and projects : In this section, only organized events, projects, and/or competitions should be listed. These are organized by how often they occur: The Yearly section is for uncommon events, like events that only occur every year, once, or irregularly. The Monthly section is for events that occur each month, or are always ongoing. WikiProject notices : In this section, any announcement, request for help or other notice from a WikiProject should be listed here. Entries should be signed, and ordered from newest to oldest. Entries are to be removed after a period of 6 months . Welcome to the community bulletin board , which is a page used for announcements from WikiProjects and other groups. Included here are coordinated efforts, events, projects, and other general announcements.

Fix double redirects A redirect is a special page that automatically causes the text of another page to be displayed in its place. A redirect that points to another redirect is called a double redirect . These pages are undesirable, because Wikipedia's MediaWiki software will not follow the second redirect, in order to prevent infinite loops . A self-redirect is an article that redirects to itself. These situations create slow, unpleasant experiences for the reader, waste server resources, and make the navigational structure of the site confusing.
